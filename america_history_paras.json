In many respects, students today are like the generations of Americans who have gone before them: optimistic and forward looking, far more eager to imagine where we as a nation might be going than to reflect on where we have been. If anything, this tendency has become more pronounced in recent years, as the Internet revolution has accelerated the pace and excitement of change and made even the recent past seem at best quaint, at worst uninteresting and irrelevant.",

We can find in other periods of American history moments, like our own, of dizzying technological change, rapid alterations in the concentration of wealth and power, and basic changes in patterns of work, residence, and play. How did Americans at those times create, embrace, and resist these changes? In earlier periods of American history, the United States was home, as it is today, to a broad array of ethnic and racial groups. How did earlier generations of Americans respond to the cultural conflicts and misunderstandings that often arise from conditions of diversity? How did immigrants of the early 1900s perceive their new land? How and when did they integrate themselves into American society? To study how ordinary Americans of the past struggled with these issues is to gain perspective on the opportunities and problems that we face today.",

Should we participate in international bodies such as the United Nations, or insist on our ability to act autonomously and without the consent of other nations? What is the proper role of government in economic and social life? Should the government regulate the economy? To what extent should the government promote morality regarding religion, sexual practices, drinking and drugs, movies, TV, and other forms of mass culture? And what are our responsibilities as citizens to each other and to the nation? Americans of past generations have debated these issues with verve and conviction. Learning about these debates and how they were resolved will enrich our understanding of the policy possibilities for today and tomorrow.",

They are stories of triumph and tragedy, of engagement and flight, and of high ideals and high comedy. When we tell these stories, \"American history\" may be the furthest thing from our minds. But, often, an implicit sense of the past informs what we say about grandparents who immigrated many years ago; the suburb in which we live; the church, synagogue, or mosque at which we worship; or the ethnic or racial group to which we belong. How well, we might ask, do we really understand these individuals, institutions, and groups? Do our stories about them capture their history and complexity? Or do our stories wittingly or unwittingly simplify or alter what these individuals and groups experienced? A study of American history helps us first to ask these questions and then to answer them. In the process, we can embark on a journey of intellectual and personal discovery and situate ourselves more firmly than we had thought possible in relation to those who came before us. We can gain a firmer self-knowledge and a greater appreciation for the richness of our nation and, indeed, of all humanity.",

This story has been told many times before, and those who have told it in the past have usually emphasized the political experiment in liberty and equality that took root here in the 18th century.",

  {
    "text": "We, too, stress the extraordinary and transformative impact that the ideals of liberty and equality exerted on American politics, society, and economics during the American Revolution and after. We show how the creation of a free economic environment-one in which entrepreneurial spirit, technological innovation, and manufacturing have flour-ished-underpinned American industrial might. We have also emphasized the successful struggles for freedom that, over the course of the country's 240 years of existence, have brought-first to all white men, then to men of color, and finally to women-rights and opportunities that they had not previously known.",
    "html_tag": "p"
  },
  {
    "text": "But we have also identified a third factor in this pantheon of American ideals-that of power. We examine power in many forms: the accumulation of vast economic fortunes and their influence on the economy and on politics; the dispossession of American Indians from land that they regarded as their home; the enslavement of millions of Africans and their African American descendants for a period of almost 250 years; the relegation of women and of racial, ethnic, and religious minorities to subordinate places in American society; and the extension of American control over foreign peoples, such as Latin Americans and Filipinos, who would have preferred to have been free and self-governing. We do not mean to suggest that American power has always been turned to these negative purposes. Subordinate groups have also marshaled power to combat oppression, as in the abolitionist and civil rights crusades, the campaign for woman suffrage, and the labor movement. The government has at times used its power to moderate poverty and to manage the economy in the interests of general prosperity. And it has used its military power to defeat Nazi Germany, World War II Japan, the cold war Soviet Union, and other enemies of freedom.",
    "html_tag": "p"

  {
    "text": "The invocation of power as a variable in American history impels us to widen the lens through which we look at the past and to enrich the stories we tell. Ours has been a history of freedom and domination; of progress toward realizing a broadly democratic polity and of delays and reverses; of abundance and poverty; of wars for freedom and justice and for control of foreign markets. In complicating our master narrative in this way, we think we have rendered American history more exciting and intriguing. Progress has not been automatic, but the product of ongoing struggles.",

    "text": "In this book, we have tried to capture the diversity of the American past, both in terms of outcomes and in terms of the variety of groups who have participated in America's making. American Indians are not presented simply as the victims of European aggression but as peoples diverse in their own ranks, with a variety of systems of social organization and cultural expression. We give equal treatment to the industrial titans of American history-the likes of Andrew Carnegie and John D. Rockefeller-and to those, such as small farmers and poor workers, who resisted the corporate reorganization of economic life. We celebrate the great moments of 1863, when African Americans were freed from slavery, and of 1868, when they were made full citizens of the United States. But we also note how a majority of African Americans had to wait another 100 years, until the civil rights movement of the 1960s, to gain full access to American freedoms. We tell similarly complex stories about women, Latinos, and other groups of ethnic Americans.",

We have, therefore, devoted considerable space to a discussion of American popular culture, from the founding of the first newspapers in the 18th century and the rise of movies, jazz, and the comics in the early 20th century to the cable television and Internet revolutions in recent years. We have also analyzed how American industry has periodically altered home and personal life by making new products-such as clothing, cars, refrigerators, and computers-available to consumers. In such ways, we hope to give our readers a rich portrait of how Americans lived at various points in our history.",

We brought Pekka and Denver on board to revise the sections originally authored by John Murrin and Paul Johnson, who are retiring. Pekka is an expert on the history of Indians, the borderlands, and the West from the 17th through 19th centuries; his presence on the team will allow us to maintain the textbook's extraordinary coverage of indigenous populations while expanding the continental sweep of the textbook's chapters on early America. Denver is an expert on British-American relations of the late 18th and early 19th centuries and thus brings to the textbook's already strong North Atlantic focus the latest and best scholarship on the topic. The contributions of our two new authors have enabled us to preserve our textbook's robust history of British America while also enhancing its coverage of Spanish America, French America, and Native America. Pekka and Denver worked very closely with our retiring authors both to introduce new material and perspectives and to maintain the great strengths of earlier editions. We are delighted that they have joined the Liberty, Equality, Power team.",

The most important change is a new feature, What They Said, which appears in several chapters in this Advantage edition. Each What They Said feature focuses on a controversial issue pertinent to the time period covered in that chapter, and presents two or more sides of that issue in the words of individuals who were actual participants in the debates. We have put a great deal of care into choosing feature themes and into editing the primary documents into a form suitable for university and Advanced Placement high school students. The primary source excerpts themselves are longer than any we have previously used in the textbook; we undertook this expansion deliberately in order to allow students to grapplewithissuesindepth,andtograsp what was at stake in key historical controversies. Our hope is that these features can be used in multiple ways: as brief modules that professors can insert directly into lectures; as materials that can be read and discussed in weekly sections; and as documents that can form the basis for weekly assignments.",

Thus, for example, at the prompting of reviewers, we have shortened the overall word length of the textbook by 5 percent and strengthened our primary source program. We have also undertaken for this edition a major reorganization and overhaul of Chapters 2 and 3 so as to encompass more of a continental perspective to supplement the textbook's already strong Atlantic focus. The textbook now offers, as a result, considerably more than did previous editions on the early history of North American territory that would become California, New Mexico, and Texas. Throughout the early American chapters, we have also expanded significantly the attention to environmental history. Chapters 4- 10 have also been substantially revised to situate America in both a larger continental and global context while bringing the latest scholarship to bear on these subjects: the role of women in 18th-century transatlantic consumer society; loyalists in the American revolutionary era; slavery and the Atlantic slave trade; the international threats faced by the United States in the early decades of the 19th century; and the relations among European empires, Native Americans, and the United States in the first half of the 19th century.",

Starting about 15,000 years ago, people drifted in small bands from Asia to North America, probably following steppe bison, caribou, musk oxen, and other large prey animals. Slowly they moved southward, some following a narrow ice-free corridor that emerged on the eastern flank of the Rocky Mountains as the Ice Age drew to a close and the glaciers melted into oceans.

A superior spear point, the fluted Clovis tip, appeared in the area of present-day New Mexico and Texas around 13,000 BCE, and its use spread rapidly throughout North and South America. As human families fanned out across the hemisphere, however, the big game began to disappear.

Some Native Americans raised guinea pigs, turkeys, and ducks, but apart from dogs on both continents, they domesticated no large animals except in South America, where they used llamas to haul light loads in mountainous terrain and raised alpacas for wool. In Eurasia, with its numerous domesticated animals, the killer diseases such as smallpox and bubonic plague took hold first among domestic animals and then spread among humans.

But in the Americas the rise of farming had little to do with animals, occurred gradually, and might better be termed the Neolithic evolution. For millennia, farming supplemented diets that still depended mostly on fishing and hunting, now of smaller animals. In many regions, the main agricultural technique was the slash-and-burn system in which farmers cleared small patches of trees, burned away the underbrush, and planted seeds in an ashy soil that was rich with heat-released nutrients. Because this system gradually depleted the soil, communities had to move to new fields after a decade or two, often because accessible firewood had been exhausted. In this semisedentary way of life, few Indians acquired more personal property than the women could carry from one place to another, either during the annual hunt or when the whole community had to move.

In the highlands, people grew a great variety of food plants both tropical and temperate. Terraces, laid out at various altitudes on the mountainside, enabled communities to raise crops from different climatic zones, all a few hours distant from one another. At the lowest levels, they planted cotton in the hot, humid air. Farther up the mountain, they raised maize and other crops suitable to a temperate zone. At still higher elevations, they grew potatoes and grazed their alpacas and llamas. Taking advantage of the frost that formed most nights of the year, they invented freeze-dried food by carrying it far up the mountains.

Narrow and long, the Inca Empire was the world's fastest-growing empire in the late 15th century. It was also one of the most ecologically diverse, covering steep mountains and deep valleys and extending from coastal lowlands to interior forests. The Incas bound their expanding realm together with an efficient network of roads and suspension bridges. Along these roads, the Incas maintained numerous storehouses for grain. They had no written language, but high-altitude runners, who memorized the Inca's oral commands, raced along the roads to relay their ruler's decrees over vast distances. They extracted resources from a variety of ecological niches, safeguarding themselves against climate shifts and crop failures, and they invented a decimal system that they used to keep records of the tribute they levied upon subject peoples. They used a device called a quipu, knotting variously colored strings in particular ways to encode information. By 1500, the Inca Empire ruled perhaps 8 to 12 million people.

At the end of a 52-year cycle, the first day of the \"short\" calendar would again coincide with the first day of the \"long\" one. Olmecs faced the closing days of each cycle with dread, lest the gods allow the sun and all life on earth to be destroyed-something that, Olmecs warned, had already happened several times. They believed that the sacrifice of a god had been necessary to set the sun in motion in each new creation cycle and that only the blood of human sacrifice could placate the gods and keep the sun moving.

The Portuguese established small posts, or factories, along the coast or ideally, on small offshore islands, such as Arguin Island near Cape Blanco, where they built their first African fort in 1448. Operating out of these bases, traders would buy slaves from the local rulers, who usually acquired their victims by waging war. During the long history of the Atlantic slave trade, nearly every African shipped overseas had first been enslaved by other Africans.",

African societies raided their neighbors for slaves, which were a significant form of personal wealth, and Muslim traders may have transported more than 10 million people out of Africa between 750 and 1500. Yet, the slavery that Europeans imposed marked a major departure. When the Atlantic slave trade began, no African middleman could have foreseen how the enslavement of Africans by Europeans would differ from the enslavement of Africans by Africans. In Africa, slaves were not forced to toil endlessly to produce staple crops, and their descendants often became fully assimilated into the captors' society. Slaves were not isolated as a separate caste. By the time African middlemen learned about the cruel conditions of slavery under European rule, the trade had become too lucrative to stop, although several African societies tried. They discovered, moreover, that those who refused to participate in the trade were likely to become its victims. When the rulers of the Kongo embraced Catholicism in the 16th century, they protested against the Atlantic slave trade, only to see their own people become vulnerable to enslavement by others. The non-Christian kingdom of Benin learned the same lesson.",

For the hemisphere as a whole, any given region probably lost 90 to 95 percent of its population within a century of sustained contact with Europeans.

At the center of the imperial bureaucracy, in Seville, stood the Council of the Indies. The council administered the three American viceroyalties of New Spain, Peru, and eventually New Granada, which were further subdivided into smaller audiencias, executive and judicial jurisdictions supervised by the viceroys. The Council of the Indies appointed the viceroys and other major officials, who ruled from the new cities that the Spaniards built with local labor at Havana, Mexico City, Lima, and elsewhere. Although centralized and autocratic in theory, the Spanish Empire allowed local officials a fair degree of initiative, if only because years could elapse in trying to communicate across its immense distances. \"If death came from Spain,\" mused one official, \"we should all live long lives.\"",

The Portuguese invasion did not lead to direct rule over native societies but to their displacement or enslavement. After the colonists on the northeast coast turned to raising sugar in the late 16th century, Brazilian frontiersmen, or bandeirantes, foraged deep into the continent to enslave more Indians. They even raided remote Spanish Andean missions, rounded up the converts, and dragged them thousands of miles across mountains and through jungles to be worked to death on plantations. On several occasions, while Brazil was ruled by Spain, missionaries persuaded the king to abolish slavery. Not even absolutism could achieve that goal. Slavery continued without pause, and Africans gradually replaced Indians as the dominant labor force. Brazil was the major market for African slaves until the 1640s, when Caribbean demand became even greater.",

Serfdom, which tied peasants to their lords and to the land, had been Europe's predominant labor system in the early Middle Ages. Although peasants could not move, neither could they be sold; they were not slaves. Serfdom had been declining in Western Europe since the 12th century and was nearly gone by 1500. A system of free labor gradually arose in its place, and overseas expansion strengthened that trend within Western Europe. Although free labor prevailed in the Western European homeland, unfree labor systems took root all around Europe's periphery, both overseas and in Eastern Europe, and the two systems were structurally linked. In general, free labor reigned where populations were dense and still growing. Large pools of labor kept wages low, but around the periphery of Western Europe, where land was cheap and labor expensive, coercive systems became the only efficient way for Europeans to extract from those areas the products they desired.",

In New Spain, as the native population dwindled, the practice of encomienda slowly yielded to debt peonage. Unpayable debts kept Indians tied to the haciendas of the countryside. The mining of precious metals, on the other hand, was so dangerous and unpleasant that it almost always required a large degree of physical coercion. In the Andes the Spaniards instituted a system of labor draft called mita, which forced communities to provide one-seventh of their male labor force for Spanish overlords. Similarly, any colonial region that devoted itself to the production of staple crops for sale in Europe also turned to unfree labor and eventually to overt slavery. Sugar production first reduced Indians to bondage in Brazil and the Caribbean and later, as they died off, led to the importation of African slaves by the millions. Other staples-tobacco, rice, coffee, cotton-later followed similar patterns. At first these crops were considered luxuries and commanded high prices, but as they became widely available on the world market, their prices fell steeply, profit margins contracted, and planters turned overwhelmingly to coerced labor. Even in Eastern Europe, which began to specialize in producing cereal crops for sale in the more diversified West, serfdom revived. In Russia, where the Orthodox Church never condemned the enslavement of fellow Christians, the condition of a serf came to resemble that of a slave in one of the Atlantic empires. Some serfs were even bought and sold.",

Between 1492 and 1580, Spain's population grew from 4.9 million to 8 million, but over the course of the following century, it fell by 20 percent, mostly because of the escalating costs, both financial and human, of Spain's wars. As population declined, taxes rose. Castile grew poorer, not richer, in its century and a half of imperial glory.

Domesticated plants and animals spread quickly from the Fertile Crescent across Eurasia in roughly similar climate zones. The intensifying food production fueled rapid population growth, which in turn stimulated rivalries and exchanges among societies. People learned from one another, and innovations moved from region to region. The use of iron spread gradually throughout most of Afro-Eurasia, and even though Europeans knew little about China, they slowly acquired Chinese inventions such as paper, the compass, and gunpowder. Steel, far more than firearms or even horses, made European colonialism possible. Steel weapons became common in Europe in the early second millennium, giving its states a decisive technological edge. European armor stopped enemy spears and arrows, and European swords killed opponents swiftly without any need to reload. By contrast, the Americas lie along north-south axes, which",

Much like New France, New Netherland depended on the goodwill of nearby Indians, and the fur trade gave the colony a similar urban flavor. But unlike New France, few Dutchmen ventured into the deep woods. There were no coureurs de bois and hardly any missionary efforts. The Indians brought their furs to Fort Orange and exchanged them for firearms and other goods that the Dutch sold more cheaply than anyone else. The Dutch sold muskets to the Iroquois to win a larger share of the lucrative interior fur trade. By arming the Iroquois, they were effectively fighting the French by proxy, buttressing the military might of an indigenous confederacy that soon threatened the very existence of New France.",

Between 1624 and 1640, they settled the Leeward Islands (St. Christopher, Nevis, Montserrat, and Antigua) and Barbados, tiny islands covering just over 400 square miles. In the 1650s, England seized Jamaica from Spain, increasing this total by a factor of 10. At first, English planters grew tobacco, using the labor of indentured servants, but beginning around 1645 in Barbados, sugar replaced tobacco, with dramatic social consequences. The Dutch, then being driven from Brazil by the Portuguese, provided some of the capital for this transition, showed the English how to raise sugar, introduced them to slave labor on a massive scale, and for a time dominated the exportation and marketing of the crop.",

Sugar required a heavy investment in slaves and mills, and large planters with many slaves soon dominated the islands. Ex-servants found little employment, and most of them left after their terms expired. Many joined the buccaneers or moved to the mainland. Their exodus hastened the transition to slavery. In 1660, Europeans outnumbered slaves in the English islands by 33,000 to 22,000. By 1700, the white population had stagnated, but the number of slaves had increased sixfold. Planters appropriated about 80 percent of their slaves' labor for their own profit, an unprecedented rate of exploitation. They often worked slaves to death and then bought others to replace them. Of the 316,000 Africans imported before 1700, only 115,000 remained alive in that year. Observers were depressed by the moral climate on the islands, where underworked and overfed planters arrogantly dominated their overworked and underfed slaves. Yet, the islands generated enormous wealth for the British Empire, far more than the mainland colonies. Around 1700, the islands sent sugar worth \u00a3710,000 per year to England at a time when Chesapeake planters were getting only \u00a3230,000 for their tobacco.",

Charles expected obedience from the Puritans, who came to realize that church reform would have better prospects across the Atlantic.

All of Adam's descendants remain under the same covenant, but because of his fall can never be capable of keeping the law; they deserve damnation. But God was merciful and answered sin with the covenant of grace. God will save his chosen people; everyone else will be damned. Even though the covenant of works can no longer bring eternal life, it remains in force and establishes the strict moral standards that every Christian must strive to follow, before and after conversion.

God, in turn, promised to bestow saving grace within that church-not to everyone, but presumably to most of the children of the elect. This communal covenant determined not who was saved or damned, but the rise and fall of nations or peoples. As a people, New Englanders agreed to obey the law, and God promised to prosper them. If magistrates enforced God's law and the people supported these efforts, God would not punish the whole community for the misdeeds of individuals. But if sinners escaped public account, God's anger would be terrible toward his chosen people of New England. God gave them much and demanded much in return.

They had never lived as part of a persecuted minority in England, nor had they experienced the joy of joining with other holy refugees in founding their own church. They had to find God on their own and then persuade their elders-who were on guard because leniency had let Williams, Hutchinson, and other deviants through-that their conversions were authentic. Most failed. They grew up, married, and requested baptism for their children. The Cambridge Platform declared that only \"saints\" (the converted) and their children could be baptized, which excluded increasing numbers from the church's full embrace. By the mid-17th century, this problem was becoming acute.",

Quakers, who arrived in New England in the 1650s, taught that salvation was available to all those who would allow their Inner Light, God's presence within a person, to shine forth-a blasphemous notion to Puritans, who believed in predestination. The clergy's answer to the lack of conversions became known as the Half-Way Covenant. Parents who had been baptized but had not experienced conversion could bring their children before the church, \"own the covenant with God,\" and have their children baptized. Aging church members resisted the Half-Way Covenant, but as the founders died off in the 1670s and 1680s, it took hold and soon led to something like universal baptism.",

Tensions mounted during the reign of Charles I, who, like Spanish and French monarchs, aspired to build a centralized realm of religious uniformity and personal rule. After governing without Parliament from 1629 to 1640, Charles I tried to impose the Anglican Book of Common Prayer upon Presbyterian Scotland. The Scots revolted and invaded England. Charles had to summon Parliament, which in 1642 rose against the authoritarian king. Parliament won the military struggle. In 1649, it executed the king, abolished the House of Lords, and proclaimed England a commonwealth (or republic). In 1653, the army named its most successful general, Oliver Cromwell, lord protector of England. When the protectorate collapsed after Cromwell'sdeath in 1658, part of the army invited Charles II to return from exile and accept the throne, but with limitations to his authority. By then the Church of England had nearly disintegrated. The new Restoration government worked hard to restore the old order. It brought back the House of Lords and reestablished the Church of England. The English state, denying any right of dissent, persecuted both Catholics and Protestant dissenters: Presbyterians, Congregationalists, Baptists, and Quakers. This persecution would drive thousands of Quakers to the Delaware Valley in the 1670s.",

Charles II envisioned England as a centralized imperial state embodied in the person of the monarch and he saw the colonies as a means to fulfill his vision. He bestowed vast landholdings in the North American mainland on the noblemen who had supported the Stuart cause during the civil wars. The king owed the loyal elite something, and a colonial charter cost him nothing. New colonies, moreover, would yield the state much-needed revenue through trade and taxes.

He aspired to design a republic that could endure-unlike ancient Athens or Rome, which had finally become despotic states. Harrington argued that widespread ownership of land was the best guarantee against absolute government. He also proposed several other republican devices, such as frequent rotation of officeholders (called \"term limits\" today), the secret ballot, and a bicameral legislature, with the smaller, upper house proposing laws and the larger one approving or rejecting them. Harrington had greater impact on colonial governments than any other thinker of his time.",

The Fundamental Constitutions proposed a government that was far more complex than any colony could sustain. For example, England had three supreme courts; Carolina would have eight. The document envisioned a class of lowly whites, \"leet-men,\" who would live on small tracts and serve the great landlords. The document accepted slavery. \"Every Freeman of Carolina shall have absolute Power and Authority over his Negro Slaves,\" declared Article 110. Carolina presented its organizers with unanticipated obstacles to these aristocratic goals. The proprietors assumed that landownership would be the key to everything else, including wealth and status, but many settlers prospered in other ways. The ex-servants from overcrowded Barbados who settled in Carolina resisted the hierarchical Fundamental Constitutions. They were also disappointed in the prospects of sugar cultivation in Carolina and instead began to raise cattle and hogs, letting them run free on open land. Some of their African slaves were probably America's first cowboys. In the Albemarle region, settlers from Virginia moved in to exploit the thick forests to produce masts, turpentine, tar, and pitch for sale for English shipbuilders. They channeled the bulk of their commerce through Virginia's ports. The settlers also traded with the Indians, usually for deerskins, often acquired from the Cherokees and Creeks west of the Appalachians. As in New France and New Netherland, the Indian trade sustained a genuine city, Charleston, founded in 1670. Charleston traders sold their Indian clients guns, clothing, and liquor, stirring competition among different groups. The Westos and Yamasees won favored status by offering an alluring commodity: Indian slaves, captured from Spanish Florida and the interior. The Indian slave trade would become the colony's biggest business and it would profoundly shape the geopolitics of the Southeast.",

New Amsterdam became New York City, and Fort Orange became Albany. The Dutch ceded New Netherland with few regrets, never having been able to turn a profit with it. New York took over all of Long Island. It also inherited New Netherland's role as mediator between the settlers and the Iroquois Confederacy. In effect, the duke of York's autocratic colony assumed most of the burdens of this relationship while unintentionally conferring most of the benefits on the Quakers who would begin to settle the Delaware Valley a decade later.

Dutch inheritance practices, which were far more generous to women than English law, survived in New York well into the 18th century. Against the hopes of England's merchants, New York continued to trade with Amsterdam. The duke boldly tried to do in New York what he and the king did not dare attempt in England-to govern without an elective assembly. A 1665 legal code, the Duke's Laws, shifted power to the governor and his council, upsetting English settlers far more that the Dutch, who had no experience with representative government. This made it difficult to attract English colonists, a problem that became aggravated when the duke of York granted the area west of the lower Hudson River as a separate colony of New Jersey to two Carolina proprietors, Sir George Carteret and Baron John Berkeley. New Jersey granted settlers the right to elect an assembly, which made that colony far more attractive to English settlers than New York.

James expected his English invaders to assimilate the conquered Dutch, but the reverse was more common for a generation or so. Most Englishmen who settled in New York after the conquest married Dutch women (few unmarried English women were available) and sent their children to the Dutch Reformed Church. In effect, the Dutch were assimilating the English. Nor did the Dutch give up their loyalty to the Netherlands. When the Netherlands recaptured the colony in 1672 during an Anglo-Dutch War, the Dutch settlers refused to assist New York's war effort. New York City became New Orange after William III of Nassau, the military leader of the Dutch Republic. The Dutch again concluded that the colony was not worth what it cost and ceded it permanently to England in 1674. The new governor, Major Edmund Andros, established an autocratic rule that alienated the colony's English and Dutch settlers alike. He arrested prominent Dutch merchants who, threatened with the confiscation of their property, relented and swore an oath of loyalty to England. He also helped secure bilingual ministers for the Dutch Reformist pulpits, which caused alarm among ordinary Dutch Protestants. New York's English merchants harbored their own grievances. They resented the Dutch elite's staying power and insisted that the colony had to become more English and less autocratic to attract newcomers. The merchants refused to pay duties not accepted by an elective assembly, and the court of assize, New York's circuit court that had been under the governor's control, supported the tax strike. English towns on Long Island joined the demands for an elective assembly, an urgent matter now that William Penn's much freer Quaker colony on the Delaware threatened to drain away New York's English population.",

Aggressive proselytism disrupted existing social hierarchies in Indian societies and created deep internal conflicts. Diseases spread from European outposts into Indian lands, devastating many coastal societies. The increasing death toll magnified the depleted Indians' need for captives, greatly increasing the intensity of wars among native societies. In the 1670s and 1680s, almost simultaneously in different parts of the continent, the mounting tensions erupted into violent revolts and war.",

To support them, the kingdom created for the first time a funded national debt, in which the state agreed to pay the interest due to its creditors ahead of all other obligations. This simple device gave Britain enormous borrowing power. The government created the Bank of England to facilitate its own finances, and the London Stock Exchange emerged. Parliament levied a heavy land tax on the gentry and excises on ordinary people to meet wartime expenses. Together, debt, bank, stock market, and new sources of revenue added up to a financial revolution that enabled England to outspend France, despite having only one-fourth of France's population. Sustained by taxes and loans, the English state was able to organize large-scale military campaigns to protect its interests in Europe and across the Atlantic. If in the 17th century the colonists had often sought distance from England and its control, they now began to look to it for protection.",

Despite the appalling death rate in the sugar and tobacco colonies, most young men remained optimistic and upbeat, as they looked forward to challenging the world and making their fortunes. Female settlers were scarce in the islands at first; families hardly existed. Even when the sex ratio became more equal, couples had few children. Life expectancy in early Carolina was slightly better than in the islands, slightly lower than in the Chesapeake colonies. In Virginia and Maryland, men who survived childhood diseases lived to an average age of about 45 years during the last half of the 17th century, still less than in England, where life expectancy exceeded 50.

Africans were less numerous in the Delaware and Hudson valleys, although slavery became deeply entrenched in New York City and parts of northern New Jersey. Most colonies had large numbers of Indians living among the settlers. In the southern colonies, most Indians were slaves, seized from the interior by English and native slave raiders. In the northern colonies, most Indians were nominally free people who had stayed behind as their nations retreated or dissolved in the face of expanding settlements. They struggled to blend in by dressing, speaking, farming, and drinking like the colonists, while quietly trying to preserve their customs and identities. In the Middle Atlantic region, settlers from all over northwestern Europe were creating a new ethnic mosaic.

Massachusetts founded Harvard College in 1636, and in 1642 required every town to have a writing school, and larger towns to support a Latin grammar school.

    "text": "Diverse as they were, the English colonies shared a key characteristic: They were all growing rapidly in numbers. The engine of that expansion was the colonial household. Ordinary northern farmers and southern great planters shared something in common that distinguished their households from those in England. With few exceptions, colonial families rejected the English customs of entail and primogeniture. Entail prohibited a landowner, or his heir, from dividing up his landed estate (that is, selling part of it) during his lifetime. Primogeniture obliged him to leave all of his land to his eldest surviving son. Primogeniture and entail became more common in the 18th-century colonies than they had been before, but they never came to structure social relations the way they did in England. A Virginia planter, for example, might entail his home estate (the site of his big house) and bequeath it to his oldest son, but he would also leave land and slaves, and sometimes whole plantations, to his other sons. The primacy of the eldest son was far more sentimental than structural. The patriarchs of colonial households tried to pass on their status to all of their sons and to provide dowries that would enable all of their daughters to marry men of equal status. Until 1750 or so, these goals were usually realistic. For younger sons, then, the colonies presented unique opportunities. They could marry earlier (especially in regions with relatively balanced sex ratios) and have more children than their counterparts in Europe. Benjamin Franklin's Autobiography, colonial America's greatest success story, boasted that he was \"the youngest Son of the youngest Son for 5 Generations back.\" Some women were able to acquire property, usually by inheritance from a deceased husband, particularly in the Chesapeake colonies during the long period when men greatly outnumbered women. Single women who crossed the Atlantic as servants were desperate people who had hit bottom in England. Those who survived in the colonies enjoyed a fantastic chance at upward mobility.

By contrast, racism directed against enslaved Africans was typically imposed from above and increasingly enforced by law. Ordinary settlers and Africans knew one another by name, made love, sometimes even married, stole hogs together, ran away together, and even fought together under Nathaniel Bacon's leadership. Class more than race separated people from one another. This changed during the late 17th and early 18th centuries when Chesapeake planters replaced indentured servitude with African slavery, brushed aside inequalities among themselves, and erected a new regime of racial slavery and white supremacy.",

Before 1700, courts often punished men for sexual offenses, such as fornication, and many men pleaded guilty and accepted their sentences. After 1700, almost no man would plead guilty, except to making love to his wife before their wedding day. But to avoid a small fine, some husbands humiliated their wives by denying that charge, even if their wives had already pleaded guilty after giving birth to a child that had obviously been conceived before marriage. Courts rarely convicted men of sex offenses, not even serious crimes such as rape.

These intrusions angered the Philadelphia Synod, the overall governing body of the Presbyterian Church in the colonies. Most of its ministers emphasized orthodoxy over a personal conversion experience.

The officers who organized these expulsions insisted that they had found a humane way of compelling French Catholics to assimilate with the Protestant majority. Reasoning also that the Acadians were not British subjects because they had not taken the oath, and that only British subjects could own land in a British colony, the government of Nova Scotia confiscated the land the Acadians had farmed for generations and redistributed it to Protestant settlers, mostly from New England.

The white population of the 13 colonies outnumbered that of New France by 13 to 1; Massachusetts alone had nearly three times as many settlers as New France.

Shocked and repelled by the brutality of frontier warfare, Montcalm tried to turn the conflict into a traditional European struggle of sieges and battles in which the advantage (as Vaudreuil well understood) would pass to the British. Nevertheless, Montcalm won several major successes. Oswego fell in summer 1756. When Fort William Henry surrendered to him a year later, he promised the garrison the honors of war, which meant that it could keep its property and march unmolested to Fort Edward. But France's Indian allies considered this agreement a betrayal of their customs. They killed or carried off 308 of the 2,400 prisoners, an event that colonial newspapers called the Massacre of Fort William Henry. Most of those killed were trying to save their property, which the Indians considered their rightful plunder. Montcalm lost heavily at Fort William Henry.

Repeal of the other duties broke the back of the nonimpor-tation movement. Nobody celebrated. The Tea Act of 1773 launched the third crisis, and it quickly escalated. Boston destroyed British tea without bothering to petition first. When Parliament responded with the Coercive Acts of 1774, the colonists created the Continental Congress to organize further resistance. Neither side dared back down, and the confrontation careened toward military violence. War broke out in April 1775. Fifteen months later, the colonies declared their independence.",

The Molasses Act of 1733 had been designed to keep French molasses out of North America by imposing a prohibitive duty of six pence per gallon. Instead, by paying a bribe of about a penny per gallon, merchants got French molasses certified as British. By 1760, more than 90 percent of all molasses imported into New England came from the French islands. Planters in the British islands gave up, lost interest in New England markets, and turned their molasses into quality rum for sale in Britain and Ireland. Nobody, in short, had any interest in stopping the trade in French molasses. New England merchants said they were willing to pay a duty of one penny (the current cost of bribes), but Grenville insisted on three.

The money question was urgent because the Sugar Act (and, later, the Stamp Act) required that all duties be paid in specie (silver or gold). Supporters of those taxes argued that the new duties would keep the specie in America to pay the army, but the colonists replied that the drain of specie from some colonies would put impossible constraints on trade. Boston and Newport, for instance, would pay most of the molasses tax, but specie collected there would follow the army to Quebec, New York, the Great Lakes, and Florida.

Since 1765, they had objected to all taxes for revenue, but in 1766, they had accepted the penny duty on molasses with few complaints. Defeating the Townshend Revenue Act would prove tougher than nullifying the Stamp Act. Parliament had never been able to impose its will on the internal affairs of the colonies, as the Stamp Act fiasco demonstrated, but it did control the seas. Goods subject to duties might arrive on any of hundreds of ships from Britain each year, but screening the cargo of every vessel threatened to impose an enormous, perhaps impossible burden on the Sons of Liberty. General nonimportation would be easier to implement, but British trade played a bigger role in the colonial economy than North American trade did in Britain's. To hurt Britain a little, the colonies would have to harm themselves a lot.",

A month later, John Dickinson, a Philadelphia lawyer, tried to rouse his fellow colonists through 12 urgent letters printed in nearly every colonial newspaper. These Letters from a Farmer in Pennsylvania denied the distinction between internal and external taxes, insisted that all parliamentary taxes for revenue violated the colonists' rights, and speculated darkly about Townshend'smotives.",

Slavery, he wrote, \"is as repugnant to humanity as it is inconsistent with the Bible and destructive of liberty.\" He did keep slaves, but only because of \"the general inconvenience of living without them. I will not, I cannot justify it.\" Granville Sharp, an early abolitionist, brought the Somerset case before the Court of King's Bench in 1771 and compelled Chief Justice William Murray, baron Mansfield, to declare slavery incompatible with the \"free air\" of England.

He insisted that officers behave with dignity and instill obedience. As the months passed, most of them won his respect.

Until a few months before it happened, nearly all colonists denied that they desired independence, but they began to fear that the British government was determined to deprive them of their rights as Englishmen. Britain's policy drove them toward a closer union with one another and finally provoked armed resistance. With the onset of war, both sides felt vindicated.

That document established a unicameral assembly and a plural executive of 12 men, one of whom would preside and thus be called \"president.\" All freemen who paid taxes, and their adult sons living at home, could vote.

When Jefferson became secretary of state and attended official social functions, he often found that aristocratic sentiments prevailed, \"unless there chanced to be some [democrat] from the legislative Houses.\"Thus the battle over presidential titles was not \"silly business.\"It was a revealing episode in the argument over how questions of power and liberty that Americans had debated since the 1760s would finally be answered.",

The second and third-roughly $24 million each-were debts owed by the national and state governments to American citizens who had supplied food, arms, and other resources to the revolutionary cause. Congress agreed that both justice and the credibility of the new government dictated that the foreign debts be paid in full, but the domestic debts raised troublesome questions. Those debts consisted of notes issued during the Revolution to soldiers, and to merchants, farmers, and others who had helped the war effort. Over the years, speculators had purchased many of these notes at a fraction of their face value; when word spread that the Constitution would create a government likely to pay its debts, speculators and their agents fanned out across the countryside, buying all the notes they could find. By 1790, the government debt was concentrated in the hands of businessmen and speculators-most of them northeasterners-who had bought notes at prices only 10 percent to 30 percent of their original value.

But he insisted that debts owed to Americans be a permanent, tax-supported fixture of government. Under his plan, the government would issue securities to its creditors and would pay an annual rate of interest of 4 percent. A permanent debt would encourage wealthy financiers to invest in government securities, thus allying them with the national state. Servicing the debt would also require a significant enlargement of the federal civil service, national financial institutions, and federal taxes.

In California, Franciscan missionaries built 21 missions on the coastal lowlands, bringing tens of thousands of Indians into the Catholic fold-and into a colonial regime of religious indoctrination, coerced labor, and social surveillance. The Indians were incorporated into mission communities in which they were exposed to new marital and sexual norms, new foods, and new lethal microbes. The result was a demographic and cultural catastrophe. The mission Indians \"fatten, sicken, and die,\" one Franciscan noted. The Indian population of coastal California collapsed roughly by half in a generation, but the missions survived, entrenching Spanish power in California. In 1821, some 3,200 Hispanics-missionaries, soldiers, colonists-lived there, frustrating competing colonization efforts. Russian trappers and traders, advancing down the Pacific coast, established a foothold in northern California but failed to push farther south.

Hamilton and his followers, who were becoming known as \"High Federalists\" for their strident views, preferred a standing army. At the urging of Washington and against his own judgment, Adams appointed Hamilton inspector general. As such, Hamilton would be the de facto commander of the U.S. Army.

High Federalists wanted a standing army to enforce the Alien and Sedition Acts and to put down an impending rebellion in the South. Beyond that, there was little need for such a force. The war was being fought at sea, and most Americans believed that the citizen militia could hold off any land invasion until an army was raised.

The act reduced the number of associate justices of the Supreme Court from six to five when the next vacancy occurred, thus reducing Jefferson's chances of appointing a new member to the Court.

Republican senators quickly ratified the Louisiana treaty over Federalist objections that the purchase would encourage rapid settlement and add to backcountry barbarism and Republican strength.

The subtitle comes from the tenth novel, The Far Side of the World, from which the film also gets its plot, with a crucial difference: The enemy in the novel is not a French privateer but an American navy frigate, USS Norfolk, during the War of 1812.

Commanded by Captain David Porter, Essex wreaked havoc on Britain's Pacific whaling fleet in 1813, before being decimated by the British navy off the coast of Valparaiso, Chile, in 1814. In the film, Acheron's French captain (Thierry Segall) channels Porter's mischievous spirit. Moreover, as a 44-gun \"super frigate\" with a heavy, reinforced hull, Acheron overmatches the 28-gun Surprise much like USS Constitution (nicknamed \"Old Ironsides\") and other oversized American frigates dominated their British counterparts in the War of 1812. If Acheron seems like Constitution in French sheathing, it is no accident.

Moreover, they wanted territorial concessions and the creation of the permanent, independent Indian buffer state in the Northwest that they had promised their Indian allies. The Americans ignored these proposals and talked instead about impressment and maritime rights. As the autumn wore on and the war reached stalemate, both sides began to compromise. The British knew that the Americans would grant concessions in the interior only if they were thoroughly defeated, an outcome that British commanders thought impossible. For their part, the Americans realized that British maritime depredations were by-products of the struggle with Napoleonic France. Faced with peace in Europe and a senseless military stalemate in North America, negotiators on both sides began to withdraw their demands. The Treaty of Ghent, signed on Christmas Eve 1814, simply ended the war. The border between Canada and the United States remained where it had been in 1812; Indians south of that border-defeated and without allies-were left to the mercy of the United States; and British maritime violations were not mentioned.

Their second was to achieve long-term security and the ability to pass their farms on to their sons. The goal was to create what rural folks called a \"competence\": the ability to live up to neighborhood standards of material decency while protecting the long-term independence of the household.

The prosperity and aspirations of hundreds of thousands of farmers rose, and their houses were sprinkled with tokens of comfort and gentility.

In the grain fields of the middle states, for instance, the long-handled scythe was replacing the sickle as the principal harvest tool. Women could use the sickle efficiently, but because of its length and weight, men were better able to wield the scythe. At the same time, farmers completed the substitution of ploughs for hoes as the principal cultivating tools-not only because ploughs worked better, but also because rural Americans had developed a prejudice against women working in the fields, and ploughs were male tools. By the early 19th century, visitors to the long-settled farming areas (with the exception of some mid-Atlantic German communities) seldom saw women in the fields.

The warring European powers also needed shipping to carry products from the Caribbean islands to Europe. America's saltwater merchants, free from the old colonial restrictions, responded by building one of the great merchant fleets in the world, and American overseas trade entered a period of unprecedented growth. Ocean trade during these years was risky and uneven, subject to the tides of war and the strategies of the belligerents. But by 1815, wartime commerce had transformed the seaports and the institutions of American business. New York City had become the nation's largest city, with a population that grew to 96,373 in 1810. Philadelphia's population had risen to 53,722 by 1810; Boston's to 34,322; and Baltimore'sto 46,555.

Store-bought white flour, butter, and eggs and the new iron stoves eased the burdens of food preparation, but they also created demands for pies, cakes, and other fancy foods that earlier generations had only dreamed of. And while farmwomen no longer spun and wove their own cloth, the availability of manufactured cloth created the expectation that their families would dress more neatly and with greater variety than they had in the past, and women spent more time sewing, washing, and ironing. Similar expectations demanded greater personal and domestic cleanliness and taste, and farmwomen worked at planting flower beds; cleaning and maintaining prized furniture, mirrors, rugs, and ceramics; and scrubbing floors and children.

They made a lot of money, and they bought a lot of nice things. Other southerners, however, were not as fortunate. Enslaved workers experienced longer hours and tighter discipline than in the past. They lost their families and friends to a soulless interstate slave trade, and they watched their masters' commitment to slavery harden into an unmovable political axiom. In addition, most white farmers moved to the edges of the commercial economy. They continued in the old-style mixed agriculture, and traded relatively little beyond their neighborhoods. In the North, country people became the great consumer market that drove regional economic development. In the South, slaves and most whites bought little, and what they bought was made outside of the region.",

In addition, it gave the South a labor system, a leadership class, and an economic and political culture that set the region apart from the burgeoning capitalist democracy of the North and from dominant ideological trends in the North Atlantic world.",

The market for tobacco, its principal crop, had been falling since before the Revolution, and it continued to decline after 1790. Tobacco also depleted the soil, and by the late 18th century, tidewater farms and plantations were giving out. As lands west of the Appalachians opened to settlement, white tenants, laborers, and small farmers left the Chesapeake in droves. Many of them moved to Kentucky, Tennessee, or the western reaches of Virginia. Many others found new homes in nonslave states north of the Ohio River.

In many parts of the region, the old tobacco lands gave way to grain fields and pastures, and by 1830, Richmond rivaled Rochester, New York, as the nation's leading flour-milling center. It was a sensible move, but it left the Chesapeake with a huge investment in slaves who were less and less necessary. Grazing animals and raising wheat required less labor than tobacco. Enslaved workers planted individual tobacco plants and then pruned, weeded, and picked worms off of them by hand. At harvest time they picked the leaves one at a time, then hung them to cure, packed them, and shipped them off to market. In sharp contrast, grain and livestock took care of themselves through most of the year. Planters with large numbers of slaves had to think up new uses for them. Some divided their land into small plots and rented both the plots and their slaves to white tenant farmers; others, particularly in Maryland, recruited tenants from the growing ranks of free blacks; still others hired out their slaves as artisans and urban laborers.",

The grain economy also required carts, wagons, mills, and good roads, and thus created a need for greater numbers of slave artisans, who were nearly all men. Many of these artisans were hired out to urban employers and lived as a semifree caste in cities and towns. In the new economy of the Chesapeake, male slaves did the plowing, mowing, sowing, ditching, and carting and performed most of the tasks requiring artisanal skills.

This new division of labor was clearly evident during the wheat harvest. On George Washington'sfarm, for example, male slaves, often working beside temporary white laborers, moved in a broad line as they mowed the grain. Following them came a gang of children and women on their hands and knees binding wheat into shocks. Thomas Jefferson, who had been startled to see French women working in the fields, abandoned his concern for female delicacy when his own slaves were involved.

The short-staple variety was hardier, but its sticky seeds had to be removed by hand before the cotton could be milled. It took a full day for an adult slave to clean a single pound of short-staple cotton-an expenditure of labor that took the profit out of cotton. In 1790, the United States 178,000 bales of ginned cotton, more than 59 times the 3,000 bales it had produced in 1790. With the opening of new cotton lands, production jumped to 334,000 bales in 1820 and to 1,350,000 bales in 1840.

The wealthier planter families bought up good cotton land with ready access to markets. They also bought up the majority of slaves. Only 30 percent to 35 percent of southern white families owned at least one slave in 1830, and that percentage dropped as time passed. On the eve of the Civil War, only one white family in four owned a slave. Among the minority of southerners who were slave owners, half owned fewer than five, and less than 5 percent owned 20 or more slaves-the roughly agreed-upon number that separated planters from yeoman farmers. Cotton, it turned out, was not democratic. Among southern whites it produced not only an unequal distribution of wealth but a dual economy: plantations at the commercial center and a marginally commercial yeomanry on the fringes.",

They voted the great planters into office and used their cotton gins and tapped into their marketing networks.

All of these areas were unsuitable for plantation crops. Here the farmers built a yeoman society that retained many of the characteristics of the 18th-century countryside, North and South.

They planted cornfields and let their pigs run loose in the woods and on unfenced private land. In late summer and fall, they rounded up the animals and sold them to drovers who herded them cross-country and sold them to flatland merchants and planters.

In the counties of upland Georgia, for instance, between seven and nine out of 10 households were without slaves. These farmers practiced a mixed agriculture that was complicated by the nature of southern cash crops. Northern yeomen before 1815 had grown grain and livestock with which they fed their families and traded with neighbors. Whatever was left over, they sent to market. But cotton, like tobacco and other southern cash crops, was not a food. It was useful only as a market crop. Most middling and poor southern farmers played it safe: They put their improved land into corn and sweet potatoes, and set pigs and cattle loose to browse the remaining land. The more substantial and ambitious of them cultivated a few acres of cotton. They grew more cotton as transportation made markets more accessible, but few southern yeomen became wholly dependent on the market. With the income from a few bales of cotton, they could pay their debts and taxes and buy coffee, tea, sugar, tobacco, cloth, and shoes. But they continued to enter and leave the market at will, and to retain the ability to subsist within their neighborhoods.

Actually, the scarcity of fences in most southern neighborhoods was the result of local custom and state law. Georgia, for instance, required farmers to fence their planted fields but not the rest of their land. In country neighborhoods where families fished and hunted for food, and where livestock roamed freely, fences conflicted with a local economy that required neighborhood use of privately owned land. In this sense, the northerners were right: The absence of fences in the South reflected neighborhood constraints on the private use of private property, and thus on individual acquisitiveness and ambition.

Convinced by a solar eclipse in February 1831 that the time had come, Turner began telling other slaves about his visions, recruited his force, and launched his bloody revolt. Turner and his followers hacked to death 55 white men, women, and children before they were stopped. In the aftermath, Virginia executed at least 40 blacks, including Turner, who managed to hide in the woods for two months.

The commitment to cotton and slavery had isolated the South politically. It had also deepened the South's dependence on the world's financial and industrial centers.

It was a religion that valued individual holiness over a permanent and sacred social order. It made the spiritual nature of individuals a matter of prayer, submission, and choice. Thus, it gave Christians the means-through the spread of revivals-to bring on the thousand-year reign of Christianity that they believed would precede the Second Coming of Christ.

The works of popular religious writers such as Lydia Sigourney, Lydia Maria Child, and Timothy Shay Arthur found their way into thousands of middle-class homes. Sarah Josepha Hale, whose Godey's Lady's Book was the first mass-circulation magazine for women, acted as an arbiter of taste not only in furniture, clothing, and food but also in sentiments and ideas. Upon reviewing the sentimental literature read in middle-class homes, Nathaniel Hawthorne was not the only \"serious\" writer to deplore a literary marketplace dominated by \"a damned mob of scribbling women.\"",

Female moral influence, wielded by women who had given themselves to God, is at war with the male world of politics and the marketplace-areas of power, greed, and moral compromise. Although few sentimental writers shared the views of the feminist Margaret Fuller, they would have agreed with her on the place of religion in women'slives. \"I wish women to live first for God's sake,\" she wrote. \"Then she will not make an imperfect man her God, and thus sink to idolatry.\"",

Crisis conversion (understood in most churches as spiritual transformation that resulted from direct experience of the Holy Ghost) was a necessary credential for preachers; a college degree was not. The new preachers substituted emotionalism and storytelling for Episcopal ritual and Congregational theological lectures. Stories attracted listeners, and they were harder for the learned clergy to refute. The new churches also held up the Bible as the one source of religious knowledge, thus undercutting all theological knowledge and placing every literate Christian on a level with the best-educated minister. These tendencies often ended in Restorationism-the belief that all theological and institutional changes since the end of biblical times were man-made mistakes, and that religious organizations must restore themselves to the purity and simplicity of the church of the Apostles.

Together, in 1820, these two denominations outnumbered Episcopalians and Congregationalists by three to one, almost a reversal of their relative standings 40 years earlier. Baptists based much of their appeal in localism and congregational democracy. Methodist success, on the other hand, entailed skillful national organization. Bishop Francis Asbury, the head of the church in its fastest-growing years, built an episcopal bureaucracy that seeded churches throughout the republic and sent circuit-riding preachers to places that had none. These early Methodist missions were grounded in self-sacrifice to the point of martyrdom. Asbury demanded much of his itinerant preachers, and until 1810, he strongly suggested that they remain celibate. \"To marry,\" he said, \"is to locate.\" Asbury also knew that married circuit riders would leave many widows and orphans behind, for hundreds of them worked themselves to death.

A murderer in Ned Buntline's G'hals of New York (1850) remarks, \"There isn'tno real witue [virtue] and honesty nowhere, 'cept among the perfessional dishonest.\" By contrast, in middle-class sentimental novels, the universe was benign; good could be nurtured, and evil could be defeated and transformed. Harriet Beecher Stowe's slave driver Simon Legree-the best-known villain in American literature-is evil not because of a natural disposition toward evil, but because he had been deprived of a mother's love during childhood. The world, in Stowe's view, could be nurtured into being good. Most northern plain folk (whether they favored church or popular entertainments) did not want to fix an imperfect and often chaotic world. They wanted only to live decently and bravely within it.",

That transformation began when poor and middling whites found spiritual alternatives to the culture of the gentry-to their formalistic Episcopalianism, their love of luxury and display, and their enjoyment of money and power. Early southern Baptists and Methodists demanded a crisis conversion followed by a life of piety and a rejection of what they called \"the world.\" To no small degree, the world was the economic, cultural, and political world controlled by the planters. James McGready, who preached in rural North Carolina in the 1790s, openly condemned the gentry: \"The world is in all their thoughts day and night. All their talk is of corn and tobacco, of land and stock. The price of merchandise and negroes are inexhaustible themes of conversation. But for them, the name of Jesus has no charms; it is rarely mentioned unless to be profaned.\" This was dangerous talk, as McGready learned when young rakes rode their horses through one of his outdoor meetings, tipped over the benches, set the altar on fire, and threatened to kill McGready.",

Though its origins stretched back into the 18th century, the first full-blown camp meeting took place at Cane Ridge, Kentucky, in 1801. Here the annual \"Holy Feast,\" a three-day communion service of Scots-Irish Presbyterians, was transformed into an outdoor revival at which hundreds experienced conversion under Presbyterian, Methodist, and Baptist preaching. Estimates of the crowd at Cane Ridge ranged from 10,000 to 20,000 persons. Some converts fainted, others jerked uncontrollably, and a few barked like dogs, all of them visibly taken by the Holy Spirit. These exercises fell upon women and men, whites and blacks, rich and poor, momentarily blurring social hierarchy in moments of profound and very public religious ecstasy. A witness to a later camp meeting recounted that \"to see a bold and courageous Kentuckian (undaunted by the horrors of war) turn pale and tremble at the reproof of a weak woman, a little boy, or a poor African; to see him sink down in deep remorse, roll and toss, and gnash his teeth, till black in the face, entreat the prayers of those he came to devour .. who can say the change was not supernatural?\" Southern white men, even when under religious conviction, sometimes resisted this loss of mastery and self-control. One preacher remembered a \"fine, strong, good-looking young man\" who felt himself giving in to camp meeting preaching. He \"found no relief until he drew a large pistole out of his pocket, with which he intended to defend himself if any one should offer to speak to him on the subject of religion.\"",

The federal government dropped the 50-acre freehold qualification in the territories in 1812. Of the eight territories that became states between 1796 and 1821, none kept a property qualification, only three maintained a taxpaying qualification, and five explicitly granted the vote to all white men. In the same years, one eastern state after another widened the franchise. By 1840, only Rhode Island retained a propertied electorate, primarily because Yankee farmers in that state wanted to retain power in a society made up increasingly of urban, immigrant wage earners. (When Rhode Island finally reformed the franchise in 1843, the new law included a freehold requirement that applied only to the foreign-born, and explicitly withheld the franchise from blacks.)

Again, wartime difficulties and wartime nationalism had paved the way: Since Americans could not depend on imported manufactures, Congress saw domestic manufactures as a patriotic necessity and a spur to commerce between the sections.

An immensely talented man without family connections (his father was a Hudson Valley tavern keeper) or formal education, Van Buren built his political career out of a commitment to Jeffersonian principles, personal charm, and party discipline. He and his colleagues in New York had begun to invent the modern political party. The Founders had denounced parties, claiming that republics rested on civic virtue, not competition. Van Buren'sNewYork experience, however, along with his reading of national politics, told him that disciplined political parties were necessary democratic tools. Van Buren insisted that competition and party divisions were inevitable and good, but that they must be made to serve the republic. He wrote: \"We must always have party distinctions, and the old ones are the best .. If the old ones are suppressed, geographical differences founded on local instincts or what is worse, prejudices between free & slave holding states will inevitably take their place.\" Van Buren claimed that the one-party politics of the Era of Good Feelings had allowed privileged insiders to create a big national state and to reorganize politics along sectional lines. Arriving in Washington in the aftermath of the Missouri debates and the Panic of 1819, he hoped to apply his new politics to what he perceived as a dangerous turning point in national public life.",

He was also a frontier nabob with a reputation for violence: He had killed a rival in a duel, had engaged in a shootout in a Nashville tavern, and had reputedly stolen his wife from her estranged husband. According to Jackson's detractors, such impetuosity marked his public life as well. As commander of U.S. military forces in the South in 1818, Jackson had led an unauthorized invasion of Spanish Florida, claiming that it was a hideout for Seminole warriors who raided into the United States and a sanctuary for runaway Georgia slaves. During the action, he had occupied Spanish forts, summarily executed Seminoles, and hanged two British subjects. Secretary of State John Quincy Adams had belatedly approved the raid, knowing that the show of American force would encourage the Spanish to sell Florida to the United States. After serving briefly as the governor of newly acquired Florida in 1821, Jackson retired from public life. It was a short retirement because only two years later Tennessee voters elected him to the U.S. Senate. In 1824, eastern politicians knew Jackson only as a \"military chieftain,\"\"the Napoleon of the woods,\"a frontier hothead, and, possibly, a robber-bridegroom.",

Crawford, who suffered a crippling stroke during the campaign, won 46,979 votes. Jackson's support was not only larger but also more nearly national than that of his opponents. Adams carried only his native New England and a portion of New York. Clay's meager support was limited to the Northwest, and Crawford's to the Southeast and to the portions of New York that Van Buren was able to deliver.

As the candidate with the fewest electoral votes, Henry Clay was eliminated, but he remained Speaker of the House and had enough support to throw the election to either Jackson or Adams. Years later, Jackson told a dinner guest that Clay had offered to support him in exchange for Clay's appointment as secretary of state-an office that traditionally led to the presidency.

In 1831, John Marshall's Supreme Court ruled in Cherokee Nation v. Georgia that the Cherokees could not sue Georgia because they were not a foreign nation but a \"domestic dependent nation\"-a dependent of the federal government, and not of the state of Georgia. In a consequential formulation, Marshall noted that the relationship between the tribes and the United States \"resembles that of a ward to his guardian.\" Cherokees understood the decision as an affirmation of their sovereignty and initiated another federal court case against Georgia. The Court's decision in Worcester v. Georgia (1832) declared that Georgia's extension of state law over Cherokee land was unconstitutional. Marshall's ruling, which was strongly motivated by his desire to assert the precedence of federal power over states' power in Indian affairs, was a victory for the Cherokees-although, as it turned out, a hollow one. President Jackson ignored the decision, reportedly telling a congressman, \"John Marshall has made his decision: Now let him enforce it!\"",

As a result, British demand for American cotton fell sharply, and the price of cotton dropped by half. With much of the speculative boom tied to cotton grown in the South, the economy collapsed. The first business failures came in March 1837, just as Van Buren took office. By May, New York banks, unable to accommodate people who were demanding hard coin for their notes, suspended specie payments. Other banks followed suit, and soon banks all over the country went out of business.",

Instead, the United States experienced an almost inadvertent experiment in laissez-faire capitalism, with results that reflected the aims of the most ambitious states. Trade and transportation networks linked the North and mid-Atlantic and isolated the export economy of the South-a result that few politicians had intended. On the political problems surrounding slavery, the two-party system did what Van Buren had hoped it would do: Because both Whigs and Democrats needed both northern and southern support, they focused national political debates on economic development and stayed away from the questions of sectionalism and slavery.

The Market Revolution increased the numbers of such persons and made them more visible, more anonymous, and more separated from family and community resources. Americans in the 18th century (and many in the 19th century as well) had assumed that poverty, crime, insanity, and other social ills were among God's ways of punishing sin and testing the human capacity for both suffering and charity. By the 1820s, however, reformers were arguing that deviance was the result of childhood deprivation. \"Normal\" people, they argued, learned discipline and respect for work, property, laws, and other people from their parents. Deviants were the products of brutal, often drunken households devoid of parental love and discipline. The cure was to place them in a controlled setting, teach them work and discipline, and turn them into useful citizens.",

The results of such solitary confinement included few reformations and numerous attempts at suicide. Only New Jersey imitated the Pennsylvania system. Far more common were institutions based on the model developed in New York at Auburn (1819) and Sing Sing (1825). In the Auburn system, prisoners slept in solitary cells and marched in military formation to meals and workshops. They were forbidden to speak to one another at any time. The rule of silence, it was believed, encouraged both discipline and contemplation. The French writer Alexis de Tocqueville, visiting a New York prison in 1830, remarked that \"the silence within these vast walls .. is that of death .. .

In 1839, William Seward, as the newly elected Whig governor of New York, fired Wiltse and appointed administrators who substituted privileges and rewards for punishment and emphasized rehabilitation over profit making. They provided religious instruction; they improved food and working conditions; and they cut back on the use of flogging. When Democrats took back the statehouse in the 1842 elections, they discovered that the Whigs' brief experiment in kindness had produced a $50,000 deficit, so they swiftly reinstated the old regime.",

Whiskey was safer than water and milk, which were often tainted, and it was cheaper than coffee or tea. It was also cheaper than imported rum, so Americans embraced whiskey as their national drink and consumed extraordinary quantities of it. Per capita consumption of pure alcohol in all its forms increased from three to nearly four gallons annually between 1790 and 1830, and most of the increase was in the form of cheap and potent whiskey. By 1830, per capita consumption of distilled spirits was more than five gallons per year-the highest it has ever been, and three times what it is in the United States today.

Emancipation in the North constituted an implicit condemnation of slavery in the South. So did events outside the United States. Toussaint L'Ouverture's successful slave revolution in Saint-Domingue threatened slavery everywhere. Mexico, Peru, Chile, Gran Colombia (present-day Colombia, Venezuela, Ecuador, and Panama), and other new republics carved out of the Spanish mainland empire emancipated their slaves. The British, whose navy could enforce their dictates at sea, outlawed the Atlantic slave trade in 1808, and the United States followed suit. The most powerful blow came in 1830, when the British Parliament emancipated the slaves of Jamaica, Bermuda, and other Caribbean islands ruled by Britain.",

Assuming that God had created blacks and whites as members of one human family, they opposed the \"scientific\" racism spouted by Democrats and many Whigs. Moderates and latecomers to the movement spoke of inherent racial characteristics, but still tended to view blacks in benign (if condescending) ways. Harriet Beecher Stowe, for instance, portrayed blacks as simple, innocent, loving people who possessed a capacity for sentiment and emotionalism that most whites had lost. In 1852, Horace Mann told an audience of blacks in Ohio that \"in intellect, the blacks are inferior to the whites, while in sentiment and affections, the whites are inferior to the blacks.\" Radical abolitionists, however, remained committed to racial equality. Lydia Maria Child of New York City declared, \"In the United States, colored persons have scarcely any chance to rise. But if colored persons are well treated, and have the same inducements to industry as others, they [will] work as well and behave as well.\" The abolitionists backed up their equalitarian rhetoric with successful campaigns against segregation in Boston's schools and public transportation, and against legal bans on miscegenation. Most of their fellow citizens disliked the abolitionists-not only because their attack upon slavery threatened the Union and the party system that held it together, but because their integrated movement and their anti-racist campaigns undermined the white republic.",

Abolitionists, on the other hand, enrolled blacks, women, and white men who questioned the old rigidities of gender and race. They attacked slavery on moral grounds, and their appeals were unabashedly emotional. Abolitionist speeches, pamphlets, and escaped-slave narratives attacked slavery less for its supposed irrationality as a labor system than for what it did to slaves.

When published as a book in 1852, it became the most powerful antislavery tract, in part because it successfully dramatized the moral and political imperatives of the northern middle class. At its core, Uncle Tom'sCabin indicts slavery as a system of absolute power at odds with domesticity and Christian love. The novel reverses the power relations of this world: In it, the home, and particularly the kitchen, is the ultimate locus of good, whereas law, politics, and the market-place-thewholerealm of whitemen-are moved to the periphery and defined as unfeeling destroyers. Based solidly in revival Christianity, the novel lambasts the rational calculation, greed, and power-hunger of the \"real world\" that was made and governed by white men and upholds the domestic space filled with women, slaves, and children who gain spiritual power through submission to Christ. The two most telling scenes-the deaths of the Christian slave Uncle Tom and the perfect child Eva St. Claire-reenact the crucifixion of Jesus. Uncle Tom prays for his tormentors as he is beaten to death, and little Eva extracts promises of Christian behavior from her deathbed. Both are powerless, submissive characters who die in order to redeem a fallen humankind. Their deaths are thus Christian triumphs that convert the powerful and hasten the millennial day when the world will be governed by a feminized Christian love and not by male power.",

Many joined the temperance movement and moral reform societies, where they became public reformers while posing as mothers protecting their sons from rum sellers and seducers. They gained a sense of spiritual empowerment that led some to question their own subordinate status within a system of gendered social roles.

Through annexation, negotiation, and war, the United States gained more than 1 million square miles, with western migration and settlement playing an important role in making this territorial acquisition desirable. Many Americans enthusiastically supported expansionism and celebrated the creation of an American empire. But expansionism aroused opposition as well. On both sides of the debate, the nation's politicians and citizens worried over an increasingly fraught question: Was this new empire for liberty-or for slavery? The acquisition of vast new stretches of land reopened the issue of slavery's expansion and planted the bitter seeds of civil war.",

President Polk could not understand the reason for the fuss. \"There is no probability,\" he wrote in his diary, \"that any territory will ever be acquired from Mexico in which slavery would ever exist.\" But other Americans were less sure. Many southerners hoped that slavery would spread into the fertile lowlands of Mexican territory. Many northerners feared that it might. The issue came to a head early in the war. On August 8, 1846, Pennsylvania Democratic congressman David Wilmot offered an amendment to an army appropriations bill: \".. that, as an express and fundamental condition of the acquisition of any territory from the Republic of Mexico .. neither slavery nor involuntary servitude shall ever exist in any part of said territory.\"",

Ever since southern Democrats had blocked Van Buren's nomination in 1844, resentment had been growing in the party's northern wing. Polk's acceptance of 49\u00b0 latitude for Oregon's northern boundary exacerbated this feeling. \"Our rights to Oregon have been shamefully compromised,\" fumed an Ohio Democrat. \"The administration is Southern, Southern, Southern! .. Since the South have fixed boundaries for free territory, let the North fix boundaries for slave territories.\" The reduced rates of the Walker tariff in 1846 (sponsored by Robert J. Walker of Mississippi, Polk's secretary of the treasury) dismayed Democrats from Pennsylvania's industrial districts. Polk further angered Democrats from the Old Northwest by vetoing a rivers and harbors bill that would have provided federal aid for transportation improvements in their districts. The Wilmot Proviso was in part the product of these pent-up frustrations over what northerners were increasingly calling \"the slave power.\"\"The time has come,\" said a Democratic congressman in 1846, \"when the Northern Democracy should make a stand.

Trist ignored the recall, signed the Treaty of Guadalupe Hidalgo on February 2, 1848, and sent it to Washington.

This revolutionary concept had begun with the manufacture of firearms earlier in the 19th century and had spread to many products by the 1850s. High wages and a shortage of the skilled craftsmen who had traditionally fashioned guns, furniture, locks, watches, and other products had compelled American entrepreneurs to seek alternative methods. \"Yankee ingenuity,\" already world-famous, came up with an answer: special-purpose machine tools that would cut and shape an endless number of parts that could be fitted together to make whole guns, locks, clocks, and sewing machines in mass quantities. These products were less elegant and less durable than products made by skilled craftsmen, but they were also less expensive and thus more widely available to the \"middling classes.\"",

In testimony before a parliamentary committee in 1854, Colt summed up the American system of manufactures in a single sentence: \"There is nothing that cannot be produced by machinery.\" Although the British had a half-century head start over Americans in the Industrial Revolution, Colt's testimony expressed a philosophy that would enable the United States to surpass Britain as the leading industrial nation by 1880.",

He contrasted this dismal situation with the bustling, prosperous northern economy and its near-universal literacy, neat farms, and progressive institutions. What caused this startling contrast? \"Slavery lies at the root of all the shame, poverty, ignorance, tyranny, and imbecility of the South,\" he wrote. Slavery monopolized the best land, degraded all labor to the level of bond labor, denied schools to the poor, and impoverished all but \"the lords of the lash [who] are not only absolute masters of the blacks [but] of all nonslaveholding whites, whose freedom is merely nominal, and whose unparalleled illiteracy and degradation is purposely and fiendishly perpetrated.\" The remedy?

In the Freeport debate, Lincoln had asked Douglas how he reconciled his support for the Dred Scott decision with his policy of popular sovereignty, which supposedly gave residents of a territory the power to vote slavery down. Douglas replied that even though the Court had legalized slavery in the territories, the enforcement of that right would depend on the people who lived there. This was a popular answer in the North, but it gave added impetus to southern demands for congressional passage of a federal slave code in territories such as Kansas, where the Free-Soil majority had by 1859 made slavery virtually null. In the next two sessions of Congress after the 1858 elections, southern Democrats, led by Jefferson Davis, tried to pass a federal slave code for all territories.

The Crittenden Compromise consisted of a series of proposed constitutional amendments: to guarantee slavery in the states perpetually against federal interference; to prohibit Congress from abolishing slavery in the District of Columbia or on any federal property (forts, arsenals, naval bases, and so on); to deny Congress the power to interfere with the interstate slave trade; to compensate slaveholders who were prevented from recovering fugitive slaves who had escaped to the North; and, most important, to protect slavery south of latitude 36\u00b03000 in all territories \"now held or hereafter acquired.\"",

Britain had been unable to accomplish a similar task in the war for independence, even though it enjoyed a far greater superiority of resources over the United States in 1776 than the Union enjoyed over the Confederacy in 1861.

Slow-sailing ships with large cargo capacity rarely tried to run the blockade, and the sleek, fast, steam-powered \"blockade runners\" that became increasingly prominent had a smaller cargo capacity and charged high rates because of the growing risk of capture or sinking by the Union navy. Although most blockade runners got through, by 1862 the blockade had reduced the Confederacy's seaborne commerce enough to convince the British government to recognize it as legitimate.

And most significant of all, on September 22, Lincoln seized the occasion to issue his preliminary emancipation proclamation. It did not come as a total surprise. A month earlier, after Horace Greeley had written a strong editorial in the New York Tribune calling for action against slavery, Lincoln had responded with a public letter to Greeley (much as a president today might use a televised news conference). \"My paramount object in this struggle,\" wrote Lincoln, \"is to save the Union . . . . If I could save the Union without freeing any slave I would do it, and if I could save it by freeing all the slaves I would do it; and if I could save it by freeing some and leaving others alone I would also do that.\" Lincoln had crafted these phrases carefully to maximize public support for his anticipated proclamation.

When the Union army began to organize regiments of former slaves, however, the Confederate government announced that if they were captured, they and their white officers would be put to death for the crime of fomenting slave insurrections. In practice, the Confederate government did not enforce this policy because Lincoln threatened retaliation on Confederate prisoners of war if it did so. But Confederate troops sometimes murdered black soldiers and their officers as they tried to surrender-most notably at Fort Pillow, a Union garrison on the Mississippi north of Memphis, where cavalry commanded by Nathan Bedford Forrest slaughtered scores of black (and some white) prisoners on April 12, 1864.",

The suffering of northern prisoners was especially acute, because the deterioration of the southern economy made it hard to feed and clothe even Confederate soldiers and civilians, let alone Yankee prisoners. Nearly 16 percent of all Union soldiers held in southern prison camps died, compared with 12 percent of Confederate soldiers in northern camps. Andersonville was the most notorious hellhole. A stockade camp of 26 acres with neither huts nor tents, designed to accommodate 15,000 prisoners, it held 33,000 in August 1864. They died at the rate of more than 100 per day.

The Union government was \"bound to secure to all persons received into her armies the rights due to soldiers.\" Lincoln backed this policy.

By February 1865, southern armies were desperate for manpower, and slaves constituted the only remaining reserve. Supported by Lee's powerful influence, Davis pressed the Confederate Congress to enact a bill for recruitment of black soldiers. The assumption that any slaves who fought for the South would have to be granted freedom generated bitter opposition to the measure. \"What didwegotowar for, if nottoprotect our property?\" asked a Virginia senator.

As general-in-chief of the army, he had opposed Johnson's Reconstruction policy in 1866 and had broken openly with the president in January 1868. That spring, Grant agreed to run for the presidency in order to preserve in peace the victory he had won in war.",

George Hearst began by investing in 1859 in the legendary Comstock Lode in Nevada-the richest vein of silver in America. \"If you're ever inclined to think that there's no such thing as luck,\" Hearst remarked, \"just think of me.\" In 1877, Hearst and business partners bought the Homestake Mine in the Black Hills, and then enriched their holdings still further by buying up the claims of surrounding miners.

Hydraulic mining, used as early as the 1850s, employed high-pressure jets of water to wash away banks of earth and even mountains in order to extract gold. By the 1880s, hydraulic mining produced 90 percent of California's gold, but it also ravaged the environment, tearing away indiscriminately at earth, boulders, and trees, and leaving desolate landscapes in its wake. The debris (tailings) from hydraulic mining clogged rivers and caused floods, ruining farms with muddy waste.

Copper mining became profitable because the railroads allowed the transportation of huge quantities of ore.

That year, a violent strike at Cripple Creek, Colorado, broke out over mine owners' attempts to move from an eight-hour to a ten-hour day. These strikes were part of nationwide labor activism and resistance in the 1890s. Ultimately the WFM would help to found the 20th-century Industrial Workers of the World (IWW). The IWW's leader, William \"Big Bill\" Haywood, later remembered being approached by a WFM organizer as a young man in Idaho. \"I had never heard of the need of workingmen organizing for mutual protection,\" Haywood said, but he soon became a leader of the WFM himself.

Mississippi (1898), the U.S. Supreme Court upheld these disfranchisement clauses on the grounds that they did not discriminate \"on their face\" against blacks.

U.S. Steel controlled 60 percent of the country's steelmaking capacity.

In 1895, the Supreme Court dealt a crippling blow to the already weak Sherman Antitrust Act when it ruled in U.S. v. E.C.

Mass production often meant replacing skilled workers with machines that were coordinated to permit high-speed, uninterrupted production at every stage of the manufacturing process. But such production techniques were profitable only if large quantities of output could be sold. Although a burgeoning domestic market offered a vast potential for sales, manufacturers often found distribution systems inadequate. This was the case with James Buchanan Duke, who almost single-handedly transformed the cigarette into one of the bestselling commodities in American history. In 1885, at a time when relatively few Americans smoked, Duke invested in several Bonsack cigarette machines, each of which manufactured 120,000 cigarettes per day. To create a market for the millions of cigarettes he was producing, Duke advertised his product aggressively throughout the country. He also established regional sales offices so that his sales representatives could keep in touch with local jobbers and retailers. As cigarette sales skyrocketed, more corporations sought to emulate Duke's techniques. Over the course of the next 20 years, those corporations that integrated mass production and mass distribution, as Duke did in the 1880s and 1890s, came to define American \"big business.\"",

Carnegie and his plant manager, Henry Clay Frick, were determined to break the power of the country's strongest union, the Amalgamated Association of Iron, Steel, and Tin Workers. Frick used a dispute over wages and work rules as an opportunity to close the plant (a \"lockout\"), preparatory to reopening it with nonunion workers.

By the 1890s, these walking cities had given way to metropolitan entities, with core areas of work and com-merce-\"downtowns\"-now surrounded by expanding rings of residential areas offering inhabitants their own homes and gardens and the promise of tree-lined streets. The intensifying congestion, dirt, poor air, and poverty of urban cores impelled the more affluent residents of these areas to seek homes in the quiet and healthy neighborhoods taking shape on the periphery. In some cases, these areas were jurisdictionally separate from cities, becoming prototypes of the independent 20th-century suburb: Brookline, Massachusetts, a town southwest of Boston, and Evanston, Illinois, a town north of Chicago, were two early examples of this phenomenon.

The 139 gallons that Chicago and other American cities were pumping a day for each inhabitant dwarfed the 20 to 40 gallons per capita that British and German cities were distributing to their residents. The scale and power of these water systems made flush toilets and bathtubs standard equipment in every American middle-class urban home by 1900. Such improvements came more slowly to the urban poor. In cities such as Pittsburgh, for example, water supplies and water pressure were much steadier in prosperous than in poor neighborhoods.

Some regarded the size of the kickback as a more important consideration in choosing a contractor than the firm's competence or the prudent use of taxpayer monies. Those in charge of designing and building this infrastructure often did not do enough to protect laborers from the hazards of working underground, to ensure that consumers used the water efficiently, or to protect local lakes, rivers, and oceans against contamination from sewage. In Chicago in 1882, the city's polluted water gave rise to a typhoid fever outbreak that killed more than 20,000 people.

Symphonies, opera companies, museums, and libraries sprouted in countless cities, often housed in imposing buildings that transformed the urban landscape. In cities such as New York, Cleveland, and Philadelphia these institutions, interwoven with newly designed urban parks, anchored ambitiously conceived urban districts meant to be places where city dwellers might escape the struggles of daily life and cultivate their higher sensibilities. Thus in New York City, the Metropolitan Museum of Art and the American Museum of Natural History appeared in the 1870s alongside Central Park, the first landscaped public park in the United States. The park's principal designer, Frederick Law Olmsted, imagined his 50-block-long masterpiece, with its 5 million plantings, as a refuge from the city, a place where people \"may stroll for an hour, seeing, hearing, and feeling nothing of the bustle and jar of the streets.\" If these same people took another hour to contemplate the artistic masterpieces of the Metropolitan Museum or marvel at the holdings of the American Museum of Natural History, so much the better.

Americans from all over the country came to marvel at this reincarnation of ancient Rome and to record their impressions in special printed books that thoughtfully guided them through the fair, beginning with the page, \"My first day in the 'White City.'\" The White City did fill many fairgoers with pride and inspiration, much as the planners of the fair hoped it would. Visitors, however, also found their attention drawn to another part of the fair, one that focused on amusement rather than education, and on the dissonances of modern life rather than its symmetry. The Midway Plaisance was a long strip located at some distance from the White City, full of concessions where one could buy food and drink, engage in games, line up for rides including the Ferris wheel, and gaze upon the curiosities that countless small entrepreneurs had gathered into their traveling dime museums and freak shows. This, Daniel Burnham, the fair's head designer understood, was \"the lighter and more fantastic side of the Fair.\" The chaotic variety of its sights and smells proved irresistible to tourists.",

The accent was on the primitive and exotic: The pavilions did not emphasize the modernizing elites of these faraway places, or their achievements in manufacture or transportation, but rather native peoples supposedly barely touched by civilization. It was hard to miss the implication that civilization occurred in America and Europe, as represented in the White City, while primitivism belonged to people of color from Africa, the Middle East, and Asia.",

African Americans understood how much this hierarchy organized not only America's relationship with much of the world but also life within the United States itself. The anti-lynching crusader Ida B. Wells published a pamphlet, with contributions from several black leaders, titled \"The Reason Why the Colored American Is Not in the World's Columbian Exposition.\" Exploring the intertwined histories of American slavery and racism, this pamphlet offered a detailed accounting of the refusal of fair organizers to include African Americans in their plans. \"Theoretically open to all Americans, the Exposition practically is, literally and figuratively, a 'White City,'\" the pamphlet asserted. Wells boycotted the fair on \"Colored American Day,\" but former abolitionist Frederick Douglass attended in order to give a stirring speech. \"Men talk of the Negro problem,\" he said. \"There is no Negro problem. The problem is whether the American people have honesty enough, loyalty enough, honor enough, patriotism enough to live up to their own Constitution.\" Try as it might, the Columbia Exposition could not erase the question of race; nor could all the striving for unity and placidity in the White City erase the presence in Chicago and every other major American city of polyglot populations of diverse ethnic origins. International populations were present in virtually all American cities of the North and West, and they would stake a claim to define them as much as the elites who built the palatial museums, opera houses, and White Cities.",

These two immigrant groups might have formed two of America's largest, each numbering in the millions, but the U.S. government began to exclude Chinese immigrant laborers in 1882 (via the Chinese Exclusion Act) and Japanese immigrant laborers in 1907.

Chinese immigrants, as a result, often suffered greater hardship than did their Japanese counterparts.

Railroad contractors in the South, for example, treated their black tracklayers like prisoners. Armed guards marched them to work in the morning and back at night. Tracklayers were paid only once a month and forced to purchase food at the company commissary, where the high prices claimed most of what they earned. Their belongings were locked up to discourage them from running away. Although other southern employers of black workers did not engage in labor practices as harsh as those of the railroad contractors, they still confined blacks to the dirtiest and most grueling jobs. The Jim Crow laws passed by every southern state legislature in the 1890s legalized this rigid separation of the black and white races.",

Serving both black and white clients, these men enjoyed steady work and good pay, but by 1910 only 10 percent of black men made a living in this way. In many cities, the number of barbershops and food catering businesses owned by blacks also went into sharp decline, as did black representation in the ranks of restaurant and hotel waiters. These barbers, food caterers, and waiters had formed a black middle class whose livelihood depended on the patronage of white clients. By the early 20th century, this middle class was in decline, the victim of growing racism. Whites were no longer willing to engage the services of blacks, preferring to have their hair cut, beards shaved, and food prepared and served by European immigrants. The residential segregation of northern blacks also rose in these years, as whites excluded them from growing numbers of urban neighborhoods.",

Black-owned real estate agencies, funeral homes, doctors' offices, newspapers, groceries, restaurants, and bars opened for business on the commercial thoroughfares of African American neighborhoods. Many businessmen had been inspired by the words of black educator Booker T. Washington, and specifically by his argument that blacks should devote themselves to self-help and self-sufficiency.

Meanwhile, blacks were so marginalized in politics that they had little opportunity to gain power or wealth through holding political office or controlling a political machine.

They fought against prostitution, gambling, drinking, and other forms of vice. They first appeared in municipal politics, organizing movements to oust crooked mayors and to break up local gas or streetcar monopolies. They carried their fights to the states and finally to the nation. Two presidents, Theodore Roosevelt and Woodrow Wilson, placed themselves at the head of this movement.",

On one issue, however, most progressives agreed: the need for an activist government to right political, economic, and social wrongs. Some progressives wanted government to become active only long enough to clean up the political process, root out vice, upgrade the electorate, and break up trusts. These problems were so difficult to solve that many other progressives endorsed the notion of a permanently active government-with the power to tax income, regulate industry, protect consumers from fraud, empower workers, safeguard the environment, and provide social welfare. Many progressives, in other words, came to see the federal government as the institution best equipped to solve social problems.",

Some have argued that many corporations were eager for federal government regulation-that railroad corporations wanted relief from the rate wars that were driving them into bankruptcy, for example, and that the larger meat packers believed that the costs of government food inspections would drive smaller meat packers out of business. So, too, historians have shown that agribusinesses, timber companies, and mining corporations in the West believed that government regulation would aid them and hurt smaller competitors. According to this view, government regulation benefited sectors of corporate America more than it benefited workers, consumers, and small businessmen.",

The regional banks were also instructed to use their funds to shore up member banks in distress and to respond to sudden changes in credit demands by easing or tightening the flow of credit.

Moreover, the bill authorizing the system made no attempt to break up private financial institutions that had grown too powerful or to prohibit the interlocking directorates that large banks used to augment their power.

The Federal Trade Commission (FTC) had wide powers to collect information on corporate pricing policies and on cooperation and competition among businesses. The FTC might have attacked trusts for \"unfair trade practices,\" but the Senate stripped the FTC Act's companion legislation, the Clayton Antitrust Act, of most provisions that would have allowed the government to prosecute the trusts. Wilson supported this weakening of the Clayton Act, having decided that the breakup of large-scale industry was no longer practical or preferable. The FTC, in Wilson's eyes, would help businesses, large and small, to regulate themselves in ways that contributed to national well-being. In accepting giant industry as an inescapable feature of modern life and in seeking to regulate industrial behavior by means of government agencies such as the FTC, Wilson had become, in effect, a New Nationalist.",

These protests reflected the mobilization of those working-class constituencies-immigrants, women, the unskilled- long considered inconsequential both by mainstream labor leaders and party politicians. Assisted by radicals, these groups had begun to fashion a more inclusive and politically ambitious labor movement. Wilson and other Democrats understood the potential strength of this new labor insurgency, and the president's pro-labor legislative agenda in 1916 can be understood, in part, as an effort to channel labor's new constituents into the Democratic Party.

To be effective, that global fleet would require a canal across Central America through which U.S. warships could pass swiftly from the Atlantic to the Pacific oceans. It would also require a string of far-flung service bases from the Caribbean to the southwestern Pacific. Mahan recommended that the U.S. government take possession of Hawaii and other strategically located Pacific islands with superior harbor facilities.",

Already in 1878, the United States had secured rights to Pago Pago, a superb deep-water harbor in Samoa (a collection of islands in the southwest Pacific inhabited by Polynesians), and in 1885, it had leased Pearl Harbor from the Hawaiians. Both harbors were expected to serve as fueling stations for the growing U.S. fleet.",

In the early 1890s, President Grover Cleveland's administration was increasingly drawn into Hawaiian affairs, as tensions between American sugar plantation owners there and native Hawaiians upset the islands' economic and political stability. In 1891, U.S. plantation owners succeeded in deposing the Hawaiian king and putting into power Queen Liliuokalani. But when Liliuokalani strove to establish her independence from American interests, the planters, assisted by U.S. sailors, overthrew her regime, too.

On land, the story was different. On the eve of war, the U.S. Army consisted of only 26,000 troops. These soldiers were skilled at skirmishing with Indians but ill-prepared and ill-equipped for all-out war. A force of 80,000 Spanish regulars awaited them in Cuba, with another 50,000 in reserve in Spain. Congress immediately increased the army to 62,000 and called for an additional 125,000 volunteers. The response to this call was astounding, but outfitting, training, and transporting the new recruits overwhelmed the army's capacities. Its standard-issue, blue flannel uniforms proved too heavy for fighting in tropical Cuba.

Yet, at the same time, the McKinley administration made clear it would not easily relinquish control of the island. At McKinley's urging, the U.S. Congress attached to a 1901 army appropriations bill the Platt Amendment, delineating three conditions for Cuban independence: (1) Cuba would not be permitted to make treaties with foreign powers; (2) the United States would have broad authority to intervene in Cuban political and economic affairs; and (3) Cuba would sell or lease land to the United States for naval stations. The delegates to Cuba's constitutional convention were outraged, but the dependence of Cuba's vital sugar industry on the U.S. market and the continuing presence of the U.S. Army on Cuban soil rendered resistance futile. In 1901, by a vote of 15 to 11, the delegates reluctantly wrote the Platt conditions into their constitution. \"There is, of course, little or no independence left Cuba under the Platt Amendment,\" Wood candidly admitted to his friend Theodore Roosevelt, who had recently succeeded the assassinated McKinley as president.",

Wilson favored Venustiano Carranza and Francisco (\"Pancho\") Villa, two enemies of Huerta who commanded rebel armies and who claimed to be democrats. In April 1914, Wilson used the arrest of several U.S. sailors by Huerta's troops as a reason to send a fleet into Mexican waters and to order the U.S. Marines to go ashore at the Mexican port city of Veracruz. In the resulting battle between U.S. and Mexican forces, 19 Americans and 126 Mexicans were killed. The battle brought the two countries dangerously close to war. American control over Veracruz weakened Huerta's regime to the point where Carranza was able to take power.",

An angry Wilson now threw his support to Pancho Villa, who seemed more willing than Carranza to protect U.S. oil interests.

Pershing into Mexico to hunt down Villa's \"bandits.\" Pershing's troops pursued Villa's forces 300 miles into Mexico but failed to catch them. The U.S. troops did, however, clash twice with Mexican troops under Carranza's command, once again bringing the countries to the brink of war.

By the first standard, U.S. foreign policy looks impressive. The United States achieved its major objectives in world affairs: It tightened its control over the Western Hemisphere and projected its military and economic power into Asia. It did so while sacrificing relatively few American lives and while constraining the jingoistic appetite for truly extensive military adventure and conquest. The United States added only 125,000 square miles to its empire in the years from 1870 to 1900, while Great Britain, France, and Germany enlarged their empires by 4.7, 3.5, and 1.0 million square miles, respectively. Relatively few foreigners were subjected to U.S. colonial rule. By contrast, in 1900, the British Empire extended more than 12 million square miles and embraced one-fourth of the world's population. At times, American rule could be brutal, as it was to Filipino soldiers and civilians alike, but on the whole it was no more severe than British or French rule and significantly less severe than that of German, Belgian, or Japanese imperialists. McKinley, Roosevelt, Taft, and Wilson all placed limits on American expansion and avoided, until 1917, extensive foreign entanglements and wars.",

On the other hand, they continued to believe with Wilson that they had a mission to spread the democratic values of 1776 to the farthest reaches of the earth. The Mexico example demonstrates how hard it was for the United States to reconcile these two very different approaches to world affairs.",

Troops dug trenches to protect themselves from artillery bombardment and poison gas attacks. Commanders on both sides mounted suicidal ground assaults on the enemy by sending tens of thousands of infantry, armed only with rifles, bayonets, and grenades, out of the trenches and directly into enemy fire. Barbed wire further retarded forward progress, enabling enemy artillery and machine guns to cut down appalling numbers of men. Many of those who were not killed in combat succumbed to disease that spread rapidly in cold, wet, and rat-infested trenches. In eastern Europe, the armies of Germany and Austria-Hungary squared off against those of Russia and Serbia. Although that front did not employ trench warfare, the combat was no less lethal.

Several states, including Rhode Island, extended these laws to private schools as well, convinced that the children of immigrants who were attending Catholic parochial schools were spending too much time learning about their native religion, language, and country. An Oregon law tried to eliminate Catholic schools altogether by ordering all children aged 8 to 16 to enroll in public schools. But attending a public school was no guarantee of acceptance, either-a lesson learned by Jewish children who had excelled in urban public high schools only to be barred from Harvard, Columbia, and other elite universities.",

Armed with the vote, ethnics turned out on election days to defeat unsympathetic city councilmen, mayors, state representatives, and even an occasional governor. Their growing national strength first became apparent at the Democratic National Convention of 1924, when urban-ethnic delegates almost won approval of planks calling for the repeal of Prohibition and condemnation of the Klan. After denying the presidential nomination to William G. McAdoo-Woodrow Wilson's treasury secretary, son-in-law, and heir apparent-they nearly secured it for their candidate, Alfred E. Smith, the Irish American governor of New York. McAdoo represented the rural and southern constituencies of the Democratic Party.

They would achieve a second milestone at the Democratic National Convention of 1928 when, after another bitter nomination struggle, they secured the presidential nomination for Al Smith. Never before had a major political party nominated a Catholic for president. Herbert Hoover crushed Smith in the general election, as nativists stirred up anti-Catholic prejudice yet again and as large numbers of southern Democrats either stayed home or voted Republican.

Western interests found a government ally in the Bureau of Reclamation, a hitherto small federal agency (in existence since 1902) that became, under the New Deal, a prime dispenser of funds for dam construction, reservoir creation, and the provision of water to western cities and farms. Drawing on PWA monies, the bureau oversaw the building of the Boulder Dam (later renamed the Hoover Dam), which provided drinking water for southern California, irrigation water for California's Imperial Valley, and electricity for Los Angeles and southern Arizona. It also authorized the Central Valley Project and the All-American Canal to provide irrigation, drinking water, and electricity to central and southern California farmers and towns.

In Texas, building contractors Herman and George Brown were bankrolling a group of elected officials that included a young Democratic congressman named Lyndon Johnson. In the Midwest and the East, Roosevelt's corporate supporters included real estate developers, mass merchandisers (such as Bambergers and Sears, Roebuck), clothing manufacturers, and the like. These firms, in turn, had financial connections with recently established investment banks such as Lehman Brothers and Goldman Sachs, competitors of the House of Morgan and its allies in the Republican banking establishment, and with consumer-oriented banks such as the Bank of America and the Bowery Savings Bank. They tolerated strong labor unions, welfare programs, and high levels of government spending in the belief that these developments would strengthen consumer spending, but they had no intention of surrendering their own wealth or power. The Democratic Party had become, in effect, the party of the masses and one section of big business. The conflicting interests of these two constituencies would create tensions within the Democratic Party throughout the years of its political domination.",

His stated reason was that the current justices were too old and feeble to handle the large volume of cases coming before them, but his real purpose was to prevent the conservative justices on the court-most had been appointed by Republican presidents-from dismantling his New Deal.

Meanwhile, new payroll taxes took $2 billion from wage earners' salaries to finance the Social Security pension fund even though the government did not intend to begin paying benefits until 1941. Thus, the government substantially shrank the volume of dollars it was putting into circulation. Starved for money, the economy and stock market crashed once again. Unemployment, which had fallen to 14 percent, shot back up to 20 percent. In the 1938 elections, voters vented their frustration by electing many conservative Democrats and Republicans who were opposed to the New Deal.

During the preceding months, probably the largest invasion force in history had assembled in England. Disinformation and diversionary tactics fooled the Germans into expecting a landing at the narrowest part of the English Channel rather than in the Normandy region. After several weather-related delays, nervous commanders finally ordered the daring plan to begin. The night before, as naval guns pounded the Normandy shore, three divisions of paratroopers dropped behind enemy lines to disrupt German communications. Then at dawn, more than 4,000 Allied ships landed troops and supplies on Normandy's beaches. The first American forces to come ashore at Omaha Beach took enormous casualties, but the waves of invading troops continued. Only three weeks after D-Day, more than a million Allied personnel controlled the French coast and opened the long-awaited Second Front.",

Although only a military victory put an end to German death camps, the Allies might have saved thousands of Jews before and during the war by helping them escape and emigrate. Allied leaders, however, had worried about how to deal with large numbers of Jewish refugees, and they also claimed that, during the war, they could not spare scarce ships to transport refugees to sanctuary. The Allies would, in 1945 and 1946, bring 24 German high officials to trial at Nuremberg for \"crimes against humanity.\" Large quantities of money, gold, and jewelry that Nazi leaders stole from victims of the Holocaust and deposited in Swiss banks, however, remained concealed for more than 50 years.

The unions' primary purpose in advocating equal pay was to maintain wage levels for the men who would return to their jobs after the war.

A familiar view focuses on Soviet expansionism, stressing a historically rooted appetite for new territory, an ideological zeal to spread communism, or some interplay between the two. According to this interpretation, the United States needed to adopt firm anti-Soviet policies. Other historians-generally called revisionists-see the Soviet Union's desire to secure its borders as an understandable response to the invasion of its territory during both world wars. The United States, in this view, should have tried to reassure the Soviet Union (USSR), pursuing conciliatory measures instead of ones that intensified Soviet fears.

Truman's advisers feared a leftist victory in Greece would expose Turkey, a nation critical to the U.S. strategic position, to Soviet expansionism. In publicly justifying U.S. aid to Greece and Turkey, Truman asserted that U.S. security interests now spanned the globe and that the fate of \"free peoples\" everywhere hung in the balance.

By 1943, the United States had begun intercepting transmissions between Moscow and certain American groups and individuals.

The GI Bill (officially titled the Serviceman's Readjustment Act of 1944) had been passed during the war to provide comprehensive benefits for those who served in the armed forces. The bill offered veterans financial assistance for college and job-training programs. By 1947, the year of peak enrollment, roughly half of the students enrolled at colleges and universities were receiving aid under the GI Bill. Veterans also received preferential treatment when applying for government jobs; favorable financial terms when purchasing homes or businesses; and, eventually, comprehensive medical care in veterans' hospitals. The Veterans Readjustment Assistance Act of 1952, popularly known as the \"GI Bill of Rights,\" extended these programs to veterans of the Korean War. Although the Truman administration never enacted FDR's Second Bill of Rights, the GI Bills did extend some of its key promises to veterans.",

Presley and other youthful exponents of fifties rock-including Buddy Holly from West Texas, Richard Valenzuela (Richie Valens) from East Los Angeles, Frankie Lymon from Spanish Harlem, and \"Little Richard\" (Penniman) from Georgia-leaped over cultural and ethnic barriers. They reshaped older musical forms, especially African American rhythm and blues and the \"hillbilly\" music of southern whites, into new sounds. Rock 'n' rollers claimed to sing about the hopes and fears of the millions of their young fans. They celebrated the joy of \"having a ball tonight\"; decried the pain of the \"summertime blues\"; complained about the torment of being \"a teenager in love\"; and preached the promise of deliverance, through the power of rock, from \"the days of old.\" Songs such as \"Roll over Beethoven\" by Chuck Berry became powerful teen anthems.",

Rock 'n' roll music spoke, however, to the concerns of its young fans. Chuck Berry's \"School Days\" challenged pieties about the benefits of schooling, as he sang of bored teenagers riding around \"with no particular place to go.\" This kind of social criticism in songs anticipated the more overtly rebellious music of the 1960s.",

Originally conceived as short-term alternatives for families who would soon move to their own homes, publicly built facilities became stigmatized as \"the projects,\" permanent housing of last resort for people with chronically low incomes.",

To monitor King's activities, the FBI illegally recorded many of his private conversations and clamped a tight web of surveillance around his every move.

In both the South and the North, young demonstrators staged nonviolent sit-ins at restaurants, bus and train stations, and other public facilities. Singing civil rights anthems such as \"We Shall Overcome\" to inspire solidarity, the sit-in movement encouraged further activism. In 1961, an interracial group from CORE and the Student Nonviolent Coordinating Committee (SNCC), a student-dominated organization that emerged from the sit-in movement, risked racist retaliation by reviving a form of direct action that CORE had first tried in the 1940s: \"freedom rides\" across the segregated South.

Although many of the Warren Court'sdecisions involving rights issues drew critical fire, the case that raised the most public controversy involved handling criminal suspects. Miranda v. Arizona (1966) famously held that the Constitution required police officers to advise persons suspected of having committed a felony offense of their constitutional right to remain silent and to consult an attorney, which would be provided to indigents by the government. Amid rising public concern over crime, political conservatives made decisions such as Miranda symbols of what they alleged were the judicial \"coddling\" of criminals and the Warren Court \"inventing\" rights not found in the Constitution.",

Other countries had fixed their own currency exchange rate in relation to the value of the U.S. dollar. But U.S. trade deficits were undermining the dollar and allowing foreign banks to exchange U.S. dollars for gold at rates far more favorable than $35 per ounce. In response, the Nixon administration abandoned the fixed gold-to-dollar ratio. Henceforth, the U.S. dollar would \"float\" in value against the prevailing market price for gold and against all other currencies in the world. This change would devalue the dollar and hopefully make American exports more competitive in the global marketplace.

In July 1969, the Nixon Doctrine announced a broader version of this approach. It pledged that the United States would extend military assistance to anticommunist governments in Asia but would require them to supply their own combat forces. From the outset, the Nixon Doctrine for Vietnam envisioned the eventual removal of U.S. ground troops without accepting compromise or defeat. While officially adhering to Johnson's 1968 bombing halt over the North, Nixon and Kissinger accelerated both the ground and air wars by launching new offensives and by approving a military \"incursion\" into Cambodia, an ostensibly neutral country.

Legislative acts, court decisions, and administrative rulings aimed at addressing racial and gender discrimination helped produce the sectional realignment of the two major parties, as conservative white southerners dramatically accelerated their move from the Democratic into the Republican Party. The civil rights movements of the earlier post-World War II period broadened into an array of insurgencies that sought to mobilize and empower people according to group identities that included race, ethnicity, gender, sexual preference, and spiritual belief. These mobilizations sparked controversies over redefinitions of basic rights of citizenship.",

Slowly, however, inflation moderated, and the economy rebounded to enter a period of noninflationary growth.

Farmers in the Midwest watched falling crop prices hamper their repayment of high-interest loans they had contracted during the inflation-ridden 1970s.

Urban areas saw a decline in federal spending for such things as public transit, housing, and job training, even as they tried to cope with growing unemployment, population loss, and falling tax revenues.

The situation looked different, however, for those who remained persistently unemployed, perhaps trapped in declining urban centers. At the end of the 1980s one-third of all African American families lived in poverty, and the number earning less than $15,000 per year had doubled since 1970.

Affirmative action would help compensate for past discrimination and for continued, sometimes hidden, prejudice that laws merely guaranteeing formal equality failed to rectify. Advocates of affirmative action emphasized that any process of selection inevitably \"affirmed\" some qualities, such as family or old school lineages, at the expense of others.

They rejected the claim that policymakers needed to craft special rules or programs in order to eliminate discriminatory barriers to individual opportunity. Even some beneficiaries of these programs, such as Supreme Court Justice Clarence Thomas, charged that the derogatory label of \"affirmative action applicant\" threw into question the talents and capabilities of individuals. More broadly, critics of affirmative action programs denounced \"set-aside\" job programs and special educational admission procedures for previously disadvantaged groups as examples of illegal quotas, violations of constitutional guarantees, and even harbingers of totalitarianism.

Freed of restrictions from Washington, the rebels argued, westerners could make productive use of lands that lay within their states. A parallel effort, the \"property rights movement,\" emerged across much of the country, particularly in areas of scenic beauty and where plans of suburban developers encountered environmental restrictions. Private builders denounced government for insisting on environmental impact assessments that might limit the ability of property owners to use land as they wished.

Markets almost always got things right, at least in the long run, while government regulators invariably got them wrong. Moreover, governmental bureaucracies such as the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) and the Federal Reserve Board were not really regulating markets in the public interest. Government bureaucrats were just another \"special interest\" looking out for themselves or for some other interest groups. They seldom acted as honest brokers between contending interests, as the interest-group pluralist model of the 1950s had claimed.

Some cared deeply about opposing new rules for affirmative action; others placed greater priority on economic or environmental deregulation. While remaining a coalition of disparate parts, however, anti-government activism (always linked to antitax sentiment) became a powerful force.

The subsequent movement toward secularism, grounded in claims about a \"separation between church and state,\" lacked both historical and legal-constitutional grounding. Both of these historical narratives pointed toward forging a new politics devoted to joining the sacred with the secular.",

After a Republican-dominated Senate rejected the Kyoto Protocol, prominent Democrats, such as the former vice president, Al Gore, continued to highlight the dangers of climate change and advocate rejoining the international forums working on the issue. They also pressed for development of \"green energy\" sources that would both lessen U.S. reliance on supplies of oil from the Middle East and help reduce carbon output.",

Increasingly, Republicans tended to live near other Republicans and Democrats near other Democrats, and people seemed inclined to discuss public issues with only those whose partisan preferences and sources of information approximated their own. Not surprisingly, the elections of 2012 saw about 90 percent of voters casting either a straight Republican or Democratic ballot rather than selecting candidates from both major parties.",

The GOP's commitment to scuttling the ACA, for example, prompted the Republican-controlled House of Representatives to take more than 50 votes on bills to repeal it, even though there was no chance the Senate would have concurred. Republicans in the Senate made the filibuster, once a relatively rare parliamentary maneuver, central to a larger strategy of blocking Democratic legislative initiatives and presidential appointments. House Speaker John Boehner, who sometimes seemed willing to bargain with the Democrats over various issues, including immigration policy, struggled to control the Tea Party wing of his own Republican caucus. Even solidly conservative Republican senators and representatives came to fear primary challenges from their political right more than general-election contests",

This decision meant that nine states, eight of them in the now Republican-dominated South and all with a pre-1965 history of overtly discriminating against non-Caucasian voters, could now revise their electoral procedures without prior approval from the Justice Department. Chief Justice John Roberts argued that the forms of racial discrimination against which Congress had legislated in 1965 no longer existed, and Republican activists promoted the idea that states needed wider authority to enact laws that would prevent people who were ineligible to vote from casting ballots. Democrats, by contrast, warned that racial discrimination could reemerge in new and less visible ways, and they challenged claims that voter fraud had become a serious problem.",

Claims that such inequality represented the consequences of post-1970 economic policy and merited redress, however, sparked emotional, polarized debates that recalled-and also went beyond-those over the war on poverty of the 1960s.

Similarly, calls for raising the federal minimum wage to $10.10 (the current rate of $7.25 had declined to less than $5 per hour when measured in constant dollars) won widespread support from Democrats but virtually none from Republicans. Neo-Keynesian economists cited models showing that a hike in the minimum wage would both benefit low-paid workers and, by boosting demand for goods and services, stimulate economic growth. Free-market economists countered with models depicting how a higher minimum wage would increase unemployment and generate renewed inflation; they continued to call for new tax cuts and reduction of the federal deficit as the path toward improving both workers' pay and the economy's overall health. Economists from both of these warring camps found fault with a nuanced study by the nonpartisan Congressional Budget Office that forecast both gains and losses from raising the federal minimum wage.",

Consequently, solidly Republican states, particularly in the South, refused to expand their Medicaid rolls. Some red state activists tried to leverage the broader constitutional logic of this ruling against federal power into claims that states could openly nullify federal mandates, especially those related to Second Amendment rights, gay marriage, and access to federal land.
